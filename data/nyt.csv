"Under Israeli Bombs, a Wartime Economy Emerges in Gaza",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/18/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-economy.html,2024-05-18T09:00:30+0000,"Amid the destruction, a marketplace of survival has arisen focused on the basics: food, shelter and money.","On tables and desks from schools turned shelters, wartime vendors lined a street, selling used clothes, baby formula, canned food and the rare batch of homemade cookies.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by Amid the destruction, a marketplace of survival has arisen focused on the basics: food, shelter and money. ByRaja AbdulrahimandBilal Shbair Raja Abdulrahim reported from Jerusalem, and Bilal Shbair from Deir al Balah, Gaza. On tables and desks from schools turned shelters, wartime vendors lined a street, selling used clothes, baby formula, canned food and the rare batch of homemade cookies. In some cases, entire aid parcels — still emblazoned with the flags of their donating countries and meant to be distributed for free — were stacked on sidewalks and sold for prices few could afford. Issam Hamouda, 51, stood next to his paltry commercial offering: an array of canned vegetables and beans from an aid carton his family had received. “Most of the goods found in the markets are labeled, ‘Not for sale,’” he said. Before the Israel-Hamas war devastated Gaza’s economy, he was a driving instructor. Now, Mr. Hamouda supports his family of eight the only way he can — by reselling some of the food aid they receive every few weeks. “Once I got four kilos of dried dates and sold a kilo for 8 shekels,” he said, referring to the Israeli currency amounting to roughly $2. In the seven months since Israel started bombarding Gaza and imposed a siege in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack, the enclave’s economy has been crushed. People have been forced to flee their homes and jobs. Markets, factories and infrastructure have been bombed and flattened. Farmland has been scorched by airstrikes or occupied by Israeli forces.

U.S. Considers Imposing Sanctions on Israeli Military Unit,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/21/world/middleeast/us-sanctions-israel-gaza.html,2024-04-21T22:54:59+0000,Israeli leaders expressed alarm about the possible action by the Biden administration over rights violations in the West Bank.,"The United States is considering imposing sanctions on one or more Israeli battalions accused of human rights violations during operations in the occupied West Bank, according to a person familiar with the deliberations.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by Israeli leaders expressed alarm about the possible action by the Biden administration over rights violations in the West Bank. ByIsabel Kershner,Adam RasgonandJulian E. Barnes The United States is considering imposing sanctions on one or more Israeli battalions accused of human rights violations during operations in the occupied West Bank, according to a person familiar with the deliberations. Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Saturday called the possibility of the Biden administration’s placing such sanctions “the peak of absurdity and a moral low” at a time when Israeli forces are fighting a war in Gaza against Hamas. Mr. Netanyahu said in a social mediapostthat his government would “act by all means” against any such move. The news about the possible sanctions,reported earlier by Axios, came only a day afterthe House approved $26 billionfor Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza. The sanctions, if imposed, would not hold up the military aid that was just approved in Congress. On Sunday, Palestinians in the West Bank went on a general strike toprotest a deadly Israeli military raidat a refugee camp. At least 10 people were killed in the raid on Saturday, the latest operation in a sweeping economic and security clampdown in the Israeli-occupied territory. Since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and detained in raids in the West Bank, which Israeli officials describe as counterterrorism operations against Hamas and other armed groups. The strike on Sunday “paralyzed all aspects of life” in the West Bank, with shops, schools, universities and banks shuttered, according to the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa. Public transportation also was halted. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

These Issues Are Testing the U.S.-China Thaw,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/world/asia/blinken-china-united-states-thaw.html,2024-04-25T04:46:13+0000,"Secretary of State Antony J.

ByAna Swanson,David PiersonandOlivia Wang Ana Swanson covers trade and the U.S.-China relationship and is accompanying Mr. Blinken on his trip. David Pierson covers China’s foreign policy and its influence in the world. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is meeting officials in China this week as disputes over wars, trade, technology and security are testing the two countries’ efforts to stabilize the relationship. The United States is heading into an election year in which President Biden will face intense pressure to confront China’s authoritarian government and offer new protections for American businesses and workers from low-priced Chinese imports. China is courting foreign investment to help its sluggish economy. At the same time, its leader, Xi Jinping, has been bolstering national security and expanding China’s military footprint around Taiwan and the South China Sea in ways that have alarmed its neighbors. Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi have held talks to prevent their countries’ disputes from spiraling into conflict, after relations sank to their lowest point in decades last year. But an array of challenges could make steadying the relationship difficult. The United States has been pushing back against China’s increasingly assertive claims over swaths of the South China Sea and the self-governed island of Taiwan by building security alliances in Asia. That effort has promptedmore concerns in Beijing that the United States is leading a campaign to encircle China and contain its rise. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByAlissa J. RubinandVivian Nereim Arab countries, from the United Arab Emirates and Oman to Jordan and Egypt, have tried for months to tamp down the conflict between Israel and Hamas, especially after it widened to include armed groups backed by Iran and embedded deep within the Arab world. Some of them, like the Houthis, threaten Arab governments as well. But the Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel over the weekend, which put the entire region on alert, made the new reality unavoidable: Unlike past Israeli-Palestinian conflicts, and even those involving Israel and Lebanon or Syria, this one keeps expanding. “Part of why these wars were contained was that they were not a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran,” said Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute. “But now we are entering this era where a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran — that could drag the region into the conflict and that could drag the U.S. in — now that prospect of a regional war is going to be on the table all the time.” For the moment, the only countervailing force is the desire of both the United States and its longtime foe Iran to avoid a widening of the conflict, said Joost Hiltermann, the International Crisis Group's program director for the Middle East and North Africa. “I am heartened by the fact that the only ones who want a war are Israel and Hamas,” he said. “The Iranians are still talking to the Americans,” he said, referring to messages sent in recent days between the two by intermediaries including Switzerland and Oman. The Iranian message, said Mr. Hiltermann, made clear they were looking to demonstrate their power, not expand the war. “They said, ‘There is going to be an attack, but we are going to keep it limited.’” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Now, it has become a lifeline. ByBen HubbardandBilal Shbair Ben Hubbard reported from Istanbul, and Bilal Shbair from Deir al Balah, Gaza. As theIsraeli military campaignto destroy Hamas pummeled his neighborhood in northern Gaza, reducing buildings to rubble and forcing residents to flee, the Palestinian laborer realized that he was running out of food. The shops had closed, the markets had emptied and fighting prevented supplies from reaching them. So he and his remaining neighbors gathered a plant known as khobeza that grew near their homes and cooked it to sustain themselves, he said. “It supported us more than everyone else in the world,” the laborer, Amin Abed, 35, said recently by phone from Gaza. “People survived the darkest chapters of the war on khobeza alone.” For many generations, the people of the Holy Land have foraged for khobeza, a hearty green with a taste and texture somewhere between spinach and kale that sprouts in knee-high thickets along roadsides and empty patches of dirt after the first winter rains. Cooks sauté it in olive oil, season it with onions or boil it into soup to make tasty, low-cost meals. Now, this green, a variety of mallow, is making up an outsize portion of many Gazans’ diets by providing an inexpensive way to blunt hunger. At a time when most other food islargely unavailableor prohibitively expensive, Gazans can harvest khobeza themselves and cook it by itself, or with a few other ingredients.

ByJulian E. Barnes,Ronen Bergman,Eric SchmittandAdam Entous Reporting from Washington and Tel Aviv The hostages in Gaza are being moved around, with Hamas shuttling some from one apartment to another to obscure their whereabouts, while others are believed to be in tunnels underground. All the while, at a “fusion cell” quietly formed in Israel last fall, American and Israeli intelligence and military analysts share imagery from drones and satellites, along with communications intercepts and any other information that comes their way that might offer a hint to the hostages’ locations. More than one war is being waged in the Gaza Strip. For the most part, the world sees the airstrikes and the ground invasion, which Israel says are aimed at dismantling Hamas and have reduced much of the territory to rubble, setting off a humanitarian crisis. Butthe rescueon Saturday of four hostages was a reminder that Israel and Hamas are engaged in another, less visible battle: The militants are determined to hold on to the hostages they seized during their deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel, for use as human bargaining chips. The Israelis are determined to bring them home. For more than eight months, the militants have had the upper hand. Israeli and American officials say they do not know where many hostages are being held. And even when they do, in many cases, a rescue mission is simply not possible. To date, Israel has rescued a total of seven hostages, but the stark reality is that since the war began, more hostages have died, either in the fighting or at the hands of Hamas. Israel has recovered far more bodies than living hostages. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

ByIsabel Kershner Reporting from Jerusalem For months, Israelis had heard only about hostages being killed or declared dead in Gaza. The “lucky” families were those whose loved ones’ remains were retrieved by soldiers, at great risk, and brought home to Israel for burial. So the audacious rescue on Saturday of four living hostages instantly raised morale in Israel and offered at least a momentary victory for the country’s embattled prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. But by Sunday, euphoria was already giving way to a harsher reality. The heavy air and ground assault that accompanied the rescue killed scores of Palestinians, including civilians, according to Gaza health officials, puncturing Israel’s claims that the operation was a resounding success, at least internationally. And the operation failed to resolve any of the deep dilemmas and challenges vexing the Israeli government, according to analysts. Eight months into its grinding war in Gaza, Israel still appears to be far from achieving its stated objectives of dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. And Israelis fear that time is running out for many of the hostages in Gaza. About a third of the 120 that remain have already been declared dead by Israeli authorities. At the same time, Israel’s leadership is grappling with an escalation of hostilities across the northern border with Lebanon and battling increasing international isolation and opprobrium over the war in Gaza, includingallegations of genocidethat are being heard by the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

ByEphrat LivniandEuan Ward Israeli forces killed a senior Hezbollah commander in a strike in southern Lebanon late Tuesday, stoking concerns about an escalation of the conflict on another Israeli front. In response, Hezbollah fired one of its heaviest rocket barrages yet into Israel on Wednesday, targeting military bases and arms factories. The commander, Taleb Abdallah, also known as Abu Taleb, was among the highest-ranking Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon to have been killed in the eight-month-long conflict, according to a senior Lebanese intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue. In an apparent nod to Mr. Abdallah’s seniority, Hezbollah made the rare move of releasing a photo of him alongside Wissam Hassan al-Tawil, a high-ranking commander in the group’s Radwan unit, who was killed in a strike in January. The Israeli military said in a statement that it had struck a Hezbollah command and control center, killing Mr. Abdallah and three other Hezbollah fighters. It called Mr. Abdallah one of Hezbollah’s top commanders in southern Lebanon. Israeli army radio said on Wednesday that around 150 rockets had been launched into northern Israel in an apparent response, with Hezbollah claiming attacks on a string of military bases.

The former U.N. school was housing 6,000 displaced Gazans. ByAaron Boxerman,Abu Bakr Bashir,Erika SolomonandThomas Fuller An Israeli airstrike on Thursday hit a United Nations school complex in central Gaza that had become a shelter for thousands of displaced Palestinians and, Israel said, Hamas militants. Gazan health officials said dozens of people were killed, including women and children. The strike was the latest in a deadly surge of fighting in central Gaza, where Israeli forces have announced an offensive against what they describe as a renewed insurgency by Hamas. The strike hit a compound that had been operated by UNRWA, the main U.N. body that aids Palestinians in Gaza. About 6,000 displaced Palestinians were sheltering in the complex, located in the central Gaza area of Nuseirat, when the strike took place, said Juliette Touma, an UNRWA spokeswoman. The Israeli military said its fighter jets had targeted three classrooms in the school building that held 20 to 30 Palestinian militants affiliated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militia that, like Hamas, is backed by Iran. Israeli forces had twice postponed the strike to reduce civilian casualties, the military said. The precise toll could not be verified, but the Gaza Health Ministry said that of the roughly 40 people killed in the attack, 14 were children and nine were women. Later in the day, The Associated Press reported different numbers, saying at least 33 people died, including three women and nine children, citing the hospital morgue. Crowds gathered at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al Balah to weep and pray over the dead.

When the four Israelis woke up in Gaza on Saturday, they had been heldhostage by Hamas for 245 days. The buildings in which they were being kept, two low-rise, concrete apartment blocks, looked much like the other nearby residences in a civilian neighborhood full of Palestinian families. Within a few hours, the captives,three men and one woman, would be reunited with their own families, the result of a risky, long-planned rescue operation in which the full might of the Israeli military would be used to devastating effect. “I’m so emotional,” one hostage, Noa Argamani, 26, told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in a phone call after her release. “It’s been so long since I heard Hebrew.” The rescue effort in Nuseirat involved hundreds of intelligence officers and two teams of commandos who simultaneously stormed the homes in which the hostages were being held, the Israeli military said. In one apartment, where the male hostages were imprisoned, a firefight broke out between the soldiers and the Hamas guards, according to the military and video footage it released of the encounter. Later, and under a hail of gunfire, the truck in which three hostages and a wounded Israeli officer were being evacuated broke down and was surrounded by militants, Israeli officials said. In an effort to give the rescuers enough time and ample cover to get the captives to freedom, the military said, the air force began striking dozens of nearby targets.

ByErica L. Green Reporting from Washington The N.A.A.C.P., the oldest and largest civil rights group in the nation, called on Thursday for President Biden to “draw the red line” and halt weapons shipments to Israel over the mounting civilian death toll in its war in Gaza. In a rare foray into foreign policy, the influential organization added to the mounting pressure from Black leaders on Mr. Biden to stop aiding Israel’s war in Gaza. Its warning comes as Mr. Biden tries to shore up softening support among Black Americans, a constituency that was crucial in catapulting him to the White House in 2020 and that he will need to win his re-election bid in November. Inits statement, the N.A.A.C.P. called on Mr. Biden to “draw the red line and indefinitely end the shipment of weapons and artillery” to Israel and any states that supply weapons to terrorist organizations, including Hamas. “The Middle East conflict will only be resolved when the U.S. government and international community take action, including limiting access to weapons used against civilians,” the statement said. The N.A.A.C.P.’s announcement came the same day thatan Israeli airstrikein central Gaza killed dozens of people at a United Nations school complex that had become a shelter for thousands of displaced Palestinians. It tightens the political bind Mr. Biden finds himself in as he pushes for a cease-fire to end the war while continuing to provide support for a longtime U.S. ally. He has recently withheld some offensive weapons from Israel and has threatened to hold back more, but has also made clear that he will continue to supply defense systems and arms that aid in Israel’s “ability to respond to attacks” like one Iranlaunched in April.

ByBilal Shbair,Aaron BoxermanandAdam Rasgon A day after the Israeli military rescued four hostages held by Hamas militants in Nuseirat, Gazans described an intense bombardment during the raid, followed by chaos in the streets from an operation that killed and wounded scores of Palestinians. Bayan Abu Amr, 32, was carrying her 18-month-old son Mohammad on the edge of Nuseirat’s main marketplace on Saturday when she was surrounded by the heavy booms of strikes from aircraft, which Israel’s military said targeted militants in an effort to ensure the safe extraction of the hostages and special forces. “People were rushing like the day of judgment; I did not know where to run,” said Ms. Abu Amr, who was on her way to pay a condolence call to her uncle’s family after two of his sons had died. “Kids were screaming, women were falling down while running.” Along with other Gazans, she managed to clamber onto a passing pickup truck that was trying to ferry people safely out amid the strikes, she recalled. One girl was separated from her mother in the confusion, while an old man lost his grip and fell off the truck onto the ground, she said. Ms. Abu Amr finally arrived home with her son hours later, shocked that she was still alive. “I won’t take my son out of the house again,” she said. To rescue the hostages, Israeli troops entered two residential buildings in which they were being held, according to Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman. Admiral Hagari said there were families living in the apartments, as well as armed Hamas militants guarding the hostages, making it “impossible to reach them without harming the civilians of Gaza.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

A Palestinian Professor Spoke Out Against the Gaza War.

ByDamien CaveandRawan Sheikh Ahmad Damien Cave reported from Jerusalem and Rawan Sheikh Ahmad reported from Haifa, Israel. Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, a Palestinian professor at a prominent Israeli university, first waded into the debate over the Gaza war by joining academics worldwide in signing a letter that called for a cease-fire. It branded Israel’s assault on the territory a “genocide” and the leaders of her university responded byurging her to resign. That was soon after the war began on Oct. 7. Months later, the professor drew even more scrutiny for saying it was time to “abolish Zionism” and accusing Israel of politicizing rape. She was briefly suspended in March by Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she has taught law and social work for nearly three decades. But right-wing Israeli politicians demanded more severe punishment and in April, the police detained her overnight. “I have been persecuted and defamed, my academic production of knowledge flattened and my home and even my own bedroom invaded,” Professor Shalhoub-Kevorkian, 64, told The New York Times. The professor is now under investigation for incitement to terrorism — a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. And though she has not been charged, her case has prompted a profound debate inside Israel about the repression of free speech and academic freedom since the war began more than eight months ago. The professor’s lawyers say she is being punished for her political views. And some other Israeli professors and students worry that the country’s universities — which had long defended the values of relative diversity and open-mindedness — have contributed to the suppression of dissent. While universities argue they are simply trying to keep campuses calm, critics say there is a clear double standard across Israeli society: Violent rhetoric toward Palestinians from Jewish Israelis is often brushed aside while Palestinian citizens of Israel who express support for Palestinians in Gaza or criticize the conduct of the war face discipline or even criminal investigation.

Israel Rescues 4 Hostages in Assault That Killed Scores of Gazans,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-nuseirat-gaza.html,2024-06-08T21:45:13+0000,"The news was met with jubilation in Israel, where tensions over the hostages’ safety have been rising in recent months.","Israeli soldiers and special operations police rescued four hostages from Gaza on Saturday amid a heavy air and ground assault and flew them back to Israel by helicopter to be reunited with their families.

ByAaron Boxerman,Raja AbdulrahimandSteve Lohr Israeli soldiers and special operations police rescued four hostages from Gaza on Saturday amid a heavy air and ground assault and flew them back to Israel by helicopter to be reunited with their families. The news was met with jubilation in Israel, where anxieties over the fate of the roughly 120 remaining captives have been rising after eight months of war. Residents in the town of Nuseirat, where the hostages were being held, reported intense bombardments during the rescue operation. Khalil al-Daqran, an official at a hospital in the city, told reporters that scores of Palestinians had been killed and that the hospital’s wards and corridors were packed with the wounded. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, told reporters the rescue mission took place around 11 a.m. Saturday, when forces located the four hostages in two separate buildings where they were being held by Hamas militants. He said the Israeli forces came under fire but managed to extract the hostages in two helicopters. One special forces police officer died. The freed hostages — Noa Argamani, 26, Almog Meir Jan, 22, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 41 — were kidnapped by Palestinian militants from the Nova music festival during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, when about 1,200 people were killed in Israel and 250 taken hostage, Israel says. All four were in good medical condition and were transferred to a hospital in Israel for further examinations, the Israeli authorities said in a statement. The fate of the hostages has been a source of intense political pressure on the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, amid the broader criticism that his government, for its own reasons, is in no hurry to wind down the conflict or to address the issue of who should govern Gaza after the war.

ByNicholas Fandos Last fall, in the days after Hamas’s deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York appeared ready to make a hard public break with the Democratic Socialists of America. Mr. Bowman condemned a rally promoted by the group “in the strongest possible terms” after some attendees glorified the slaughter of 1,200 Israelis. His office also took the opportunity to publicize for the first time that he hadlet his own D.S.A. membership lapseamid earlier disagreements over funding for Israeli defenses. But in a private video meeting with the group late last month, Mr. Bowman insisted he had never actually left, shifting his story as he sought to mend fences with the small but influential group amid a primary challenge that has become a symbolic test of his party’s divisions over Israel. “I’m still a member,” the congressman said in a recording of the May 26 meeting that was obtained and verified by The New York Times. “I didn’t let my dues lapse.” Pressed by members to explain why his office had publicly stated otherwise, he added: “Media has a tendency to talk about B.S., and not focus on the race.

4 Israeli Soldiers Are Killed in Rafah in Apparent Ambush,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/world/middleeast/israel-soldiers-killed-hamas-rafah.html,2024-06-11T10:42:56+0000,Israel said the soldiers were killed when Hamas militants detonated explosives in a three-story building. Some wounded soldiers were in critical condition.,The Israeli military said Tuesday that four Israeli soldiers had been killed and several more wounded after militants blew up a building where the troops were operating in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.,"Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Israel said the soldiers were killed when Hamas militants detonated explosives in a three-story building. Some wounded soldiers were in critical condition. ByErika Solomon,Abu Bakr BashirandAaron Boxerman The Israeli military said Tuesday that four Israeli soldiers had been killed and several more wounded after militants blew up a building where the troops were operating in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Some of the soldiers were in critical condition after the attack on Monday, the military said. Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster, said that five soldiers had been hospitalized, and that two were in intensive care. The Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s military wing, said in a statement that it had booby-trapped the building where the soldiers were operating. “Our fighters were able to blow up a house rigged with explosives where Zionist forces had fortified themselves inside,” it said. The apparent ambush targeted an Israeli reconnaissance unit that was scouting what the soldiers thought was a tunnel shaft inside a three-story building, according to Kan. Israeli forces in Gaza have been focusing on destroying tunnels used by Hamas militants. After the explosives were detonated, Hamas forces attacked with mortar fire as Israeli forces tried to evacuate the dead and wounded, according to both the militant group and the Israeli military. Fighting in Rafah has raged on and off since early May, when Israeli soldiers moved into the southern city despite strong opposition from the international community. For months, Rafah had housed more than half the residents of Gaza. Israeli forces had directed people to take shelter there from fighting elsewhere in the territory. Since the Israeli incursion into Rafah, many displaced Palestinians have fled to central Gaza, which in turn has seen clashes and heavy bombardment since Israel announced new military operations there last week. On Saturday, more than 200 Gazans were killed, according to health authorities, in the central city of Nuseiratduring an Israeli military operation that freed four Israeli hostages. In the eight months since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks, a total of 298 of its soldiers have been killed, according to the Israeli military. The toll has been many times higher for Gazans: Local health authorities say more than 36,000 people have been killed, a tally that does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.

Patrick Kingsley visited the site. The men sat in rows, handcuffed and blindfolded, unable to see the Israeli soldiers who stood watch over them from the other side of a mesh fence. They were barred from talking more loudly than a murmur, and forbidden to stand or sleep except when authorized. A few knelt in prayer. One was being inspected by a paramedic. Another was briefly allowed to remove his handcuffs to wash himself. The hundreds of other Gazan detainees sat in silence. They were all cut off from the outside world, prevented for weeks from contacting lawyers or relatives. This was the scene one afternoon in late May at a military hangar inside Sde Teiman, an army base in southern Israel that has become synonymous withthe detentionof Gazan Palestinians. Most Gazans captured since the start of the war on Oct. 7 have been brought to the site for initial interrogation, according to the Israeli military. The military, which has not previously granted access to the media, allowed The New York Times to briefly see part of the detention facility as well as to interview its commanders and other officials, on condition of preserving their anonymity. Once an obscure barracks, Sde Teiman is now a makeshift interrogation site and a major focus of accusations that the Israeli military hasmistreated detainees, including people later determined to have no ties to Hamas or other armed groups. In interviews, former detainees described beatings and other abuse in the facility.

U.N.

ByNick Cumming-Bruce Reporting from Geneva A United Nations commission investigating the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent conflict in Gaza has accused both Palestinian armed groups and Israel of committing war crimes, and the panel said that Israel’s conduct of the war included crimes against humanity. In a report released on Wednesday, the three-person commission — led by Navi Pillay, a former United Nations human rights chief — provided the most detailed U.N. examination yet of events on and since Oct. 7. The report does not itself carry any penalties, but it lays out a legal analysis of actions in the Gaza conflict that is likely to be weighed by the International Court of Justice and in other international criminal proceedings. Israeldid not cooperatewith the investigation and protested the panel’s assessment of its behavior, the panel said. The report said that Hamas’s military wing and six other Palestinian armed groups — aided in some instances by Palestinian civilians — killed and tortured people during the Oct. 7 assault on Israel in which more than 800 civilians were among the more than 1,200 killed. An additional 252 people, including 36 children, were taken hostage, the report said. “Many abductions were carried out with significant physical, mental and sexual violence and degrading and humiliating treatment, including in some cases parading the abductees,” the report said. “Women and women’s bodies were used as victory trophies by male perpetrators.” The commission also reviewed allegations by journalists and the Israeli authorities that Palestinian militants had committed rape, but it said that it had “not been able to independently verify such allegations” because Israel had not cooperated with the inquiry. The report cited “a lack of access to victims, witnesses and crime sites and the obstruction of its investigations by the Israeli authorities.” Hamas has rejected all accusations that its forces engaged in sexual violence against Israeli women, the commission noted.

BySheera Frenkel Reporting from Tel Aviv Israel organized and paid for an influence campaign last year targeting U.S. lawmakers and the American public with pro-Israel messaging, as it aimed to foster support for its actions in thewar in Gaza, according to officials involved in the effort and documents related to the operation. The covert campaign was commissioned by Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, a government body that connects Jews around the world with the State of Israel, four Israeli officials said. The ministry allocated about $2 million to the operation and hired Stoic, a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv, to carry it out, according to the officials and the documents. The campaign began in October and remains active on the platform X. At its peak, it used hundreds of fake accounts that posed as real Americans on X, Facebook and Instagram to post pro-Israel comments. The accounts focused on U.S. lawmakers, particularly ones who are Black and Democrats, such as Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader from New York, and Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, with posts urging them to continue funding Israel’s military. ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, was used to generate many of the posts. The campaign also created three fake English-language news sites featuring pro-Israel articles. The Israeli government’s connection to the influence operation, which The New York Times verified with four current and former members of the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and documents about the campaign, has not previously been reported. FakeReporter, an Israeli misinformation watchdog, identified the effort in March. Last week, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, andOpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, said they had also found and disrupted the operation. The secretive campaign signals the lengths Israel was willing to go to sway American opinion on the war in Gaza. The United States has long been one of Israel’s staunchest allies, with President Biden recently signinga $15 billion military aid packagefor the country. But the conflict has beenunpopular with many Americans, who have called for Mr. Biden to withdraw support for Israel in the face of mounting civilian deaths in Gaza.

ByAdam Rasgon Reporting from Jerusalem The Israeli politician Benny Gantz, a key member of the country’s war cabinet, quit the government on Sunday over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s handling of the war in Gaza. The resignation dealt a blow to the appearance of unity that Mr. Netanyahu was able to marshal at the start of the conflict and exposed the divisions at the top of the Israeli leadership over the future of the war and its aftermath. Mr. Gantz, a centrist figure who last month threatened to resign unless Mr. Netanyahu addressed his concerns about how the war would end and what would follow it, said his party was leaving the emergency government “with a heavy but complete heart.” He said that Mr. Netanyahu’s leadership was “preventing us from advancing to the real victory.” The move is unlikely to force Mr. Netanyahu from office — the prime minister’s government will still hold a narrow majority in Israel’s Parliament. Mr. Gantz’s exit comes as frustration mounts over the failure to decisively topple Hamas or to bring home all the hostages held in Gaza after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on southern Israel. Mr. Netanyahu has also faced international criticism as the destruction and civilian casualties have mounted in Gaza. Last month, Mr. Gantz set a Saturday deadline for Mr. Netanyahu to meet his demands for answers on a host of issues, including a plan to return hostages held in Gaza. He scheduled a news conference for Saturday, but postponed his remarks after Israeli authorities announcedthe rescue of four hostages. In televised remarks on Sunday evening, Mr. Gantz offered his view of a “real victory,” saying it included prioritizing the return of hostages over one’s political survival — a clear jab at the prime minister. He also said it would combine “military success” with a diplomatic initiative, toppling Hamas and replacing it with an alternative government. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMichael Crowley,Matthew Mpoke BiggandThomas Fuller A day after the United Nations Security Councilendorsed a U.S.-backed cease-fire proposalfor the Gaza Strip, the focus shifted on Tuesday to the willingness of Israel and Hamas, under growing international pressure to end the war, to make a deal. Each side made positive but vague statements about the cease-fire plan and blamed the other for prolonging a war that has devastated Gaza. But neither said it would formally embrace the proposal, which was outlined last month in a speech by President Biden and was the basis of the 14-0 vote in the Security Council on Monday. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, touring the region for the eighth time since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 assault on Israel, said on Tuesday that the fate of the cease-fire proposal rested with Hamas’s top leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. Husam Badran, a senior Hamas official, countered that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was “the sole obstacle to reaching an agreement that would end the war.” An Israeli government official said in a statement that the proposed deal “enables Israel to achieve” its war goals, including destroying Hamas’s capabilities and freeing all the hostages held in Gaza by Hamas and its allies. But the official, who could be quoted only on that condition that the name and office be withheld, stopped short of saying whether Israel would accept the agreement. Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly declined to take a firm stand on the plan. Last week, he sowed doubts when he called the idea of a negotiated permanent cease-fire — which Hamas has called essential — a “nonstarter.” Far-right elements of his governing coalition have threatened to bolt if Mr. Netanyahu accepts a cease-fire, potentially toppling him from power.

The military said it targeted Hamas fighters at a school compound in Shati, a coastal neighborhood northwest of Gaza City’s downtown. The number of casualties was unclear. “Hamas systematically, intentionally and strategically places its infrastructure and operates from within civilian areas in full violation of international law and while putting the lives of Gazan civilians at risk,” the Israeli military said in a statement after the strike. Friday’s attack occurred a day aftera strike on a similar school complexnearby in Nuseirat where displaced civilians had taken shelter. The Gazan health authorities said women and children were among those killed in that strike. Israel on Friday offered a full-throated defense of Thursday’s raid, saying that its forces had targeted 20 to 30 militants who it said were using three classrooms in the former school as a base. The attacks on the U.N. complexes in central Gaza reflect Israel’s laborious efforts to repacify areas where officials had formerly said Hamas had largely been suppressed.

ByRonen BergmanandAaron Boxerman The Israeli military’s mission to rescue four hostages was a rare operation that required weeks of planning, and was given the final go-ahead just a few minutes before it commenced on Saturday morning, according to Israeli officials. Israeli special forces, backed by the military, intelligence and air force, raided two buildings several hundred feet apart in a neighborhood in Nuseirat, in central Gaza. They brought home the four hostages — Noa Argamani, 26; Almog Meir Jan, 22; Andrey Kozlov, 27; and Shlomi Ziv, 41 — alive and in good medical condition. One police officer, part of the force that led the raid, was killed. Scores of Palestinians, including women and children, were killed during the rescue operation, according to local Gaza health officials. The Israeli military said it had targeted militants who had threatened its forces as they sought to extract the hostages. Neither the Israeli military nor Palestinian health officials provided a breakdown of civilians and combatants killed in the raid. Israeli troops have swept through much of Gaza since their ground invasion began in late October. But they have managed to rescue only seven living hostages in three separate military operations, with roughly 120 captives remaining in Gaza. Several proposed rescue missions did not go forward for fear that the hostages or the forces would die in the process, according to two Israeli defense officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive operation. In December, Israeli special forces tried to rescue a hostage from Hamas captivity, according to the two defense officials.

U.S. Intelligence Helped Israel Rescue Four Hostages in Gaza,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/world/middleeast/us-intelligence-israel-hostage-rescue.html,2024-06-08T15:56:08+0000,Intelligence collection and analysis teams from the U.S. and the U.K. have been in Israel throughout the war.,"The U.S. provided intelligence on the hostages before Israel’s successful rescue operation Saturday, according to American and Israeli officials briefed on the assistance.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Intelligence collection and analysis teams from the U.S. and the U.K. have been in Israel throughout the war. ByJulian E. Barnes,Ronen BergmanandMichael D. Shear The U.S. provided intelligence on the hostages before Israel’s successful rescue operation Saturday, according to American and Israeli officials briefed on the assistance. A team of American hostage recovery officials stationed in Israel assisted the Israeli military’s effort to rescue the four captives by providing intelligence and other logistical support, one American official said, speaking without attribution to discuss the sensitive operation. Intelligence collection and analysis teams from the United States and Britain have been in Israel throughout the war, assisting Israeli intelligence in collecting and analyzing information related to the hostages, some of them citizens of both countries, according to a senior Israeli defense official familiar with the effort to locate and rescue the hostages. Two Israeli intelligence officials said the American military officials in Israel provided some of the intelligence about the hostages rescued Saturday. Speaking in Paris after meeting with Emmanuel Macron of France, President Biden said he welcomed “the safe rescue of four hostages that were returned to their families in Israel.” “We won’t stop working until all the hostages come home and a cease-fire is reached,” he added, “and it’s essential.” The Pentagon and the C.I.A. have been providing information collected from drone flights over Gaza, communications intercepts and other sources about the potential location of hostages. While Israel has its own intelligence, the United States and Britain have been able to provide intelligence from the air and cyberspace that Israel cannot collect on its own, the Israeli official said. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, celebrated the rescue, and referred glancingly at the American assistance. “The United States is supporting all efforts to secure the release of hostages still held by Hamas, including American citizens,” Mr. Sullivan said in a statement. “This includes through ongoing negotiations or other means.” Mr. Sullivan added that the cease-fire proposal currently being discussed by negotiators from Hamas, Israel, Egypt, Qatar and the United States would be the way to bring home the remaining hostages. “The hostage release and cease-fire deal that is now on the table would secure the release of all the remaining hostages together with security assurances for Israel and relief for the innocent civilians in Gaza,” he said. American officials have said their intelligence support for Israel is focused on the location of hostages and information about Hamas’s top leadership. In large measure this is because American officials believe the best way to persuade Israel to end the war is to get back its hostages and capture or kill top Hamas leaders. The Israeli official said neither the American nor British teams were involved in the planning or execution of the military operations to rescue the hostages. Israelis, experts in hostage rescue, would have required little support in the tactical planning. But the American and Israeli officials said the outside intelligence did provide added value.

They also accuse Israel of collective punishment and crimes against humanity in Gaza. ByErika Solomon A commission at the United Nations published a report on Wednesday detailing acts of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, accusing both sides of war crimes and arguing that the immense loss of life in the Gaza Strip amounted to a crime against humanity. The report consisted of two parallel investigations, one focused on the Oct. 7 attack on Israel led by the armed Palestinian group Hamas, and the other on Israel’s military response. It is one of the most detailed examinations thus far of the conflict and provides legal analysis that is likely to be used in future criminal proceedings related to the war in Gaza. Here is a closer look at the commission’s findings. According to the report, 800 civilians were among the more than 1,200 killed by Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups involved in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. More than 250 additional people — including 36 children — were taken hostage, the commission said. The commission accused Israeli forces of responding to the Hamas-led attacks in such a way that amounted to collective punishment against Palestinians, with a lethal toll on civilians that constituted a crime against humanity. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said more than 37,000 people are now dead, though it does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The commission said both sides were responsible for killing civilians despite their identifying themselves as noncombatants. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

A Careful Dance: How Hezbollah and Israel Have Kept the Lid on a Wider War,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/world/middleeast/lebanon-israel-hezbollah.html,2024-06-07T04:01:59+0000,Both sides have their reasons for calibrating their attacks to avoid a regional conflict.,"Set to a peppy electronic soundtrack, a recent video clip showed what the Hezbollah militia said was a missile-firing drone, a new weapon in its arsenal as it ratchets up its strikes on Israel.","Middle EastCrisis Both sides have their reasons for calibrating their attacks to avoid a regional conflict.

Mourners at a funeral for a member of Hezbollah who was killed in an Israeli attack in Lebanon last month.Credit... Supported by ByNeil MacFarquhar,Hwaida SaadandEuan Ward Photographs byDiego Ibarra Sanchez Set to a peppy electronic soundtrack, a recent video clip showed what the Hezbollah militia said was a missile-firing drone, a new weapon in its arsenal as it ratchets up its strikes on Israel. Flaunting a new weapon is the type of muscle flexing that Hassan Nasrallah, the organization’s elusive leader, crows about. “What protects you is your strength, your courage, your fists, your weapons, your missiles and your presence in the field,” he said in an address earlier this year. Hezbollah’s attacks, which started last October in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza war, have gradually intensified as the group uses larger and more sophisticated weapons to strike more often and deeper beyond the border between Israel and Lebanon. Israel, too, is hitting targets farther into Lebanon. The latest surge by Hezbollah came this week, with a series of daily drone strikes by the militia hitting some civilian targets well into Israel. Senior officials starting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stoked their rhetorical threats against Hezbollah, suggesting that a day of reckoning was close at hand. Yet whenever the fighting escalates, both Hezbollah and Israel seem to calibrate their tit-for-tat attacks so that no strike starts a larger conflict. While concerns about a wider war remain, both sides appear hamstrung in different ways that force restraint. The video clip — released by Hezbollah’s military media office in May — illustrates how in some ways, the group has never been stronger. Its main patron, Iran, has supplied an increasingly powerful range of missiles. Plus Hezbollah gained valuable battlefield experience after years of deploying what is believed to be at least 2,500 special forces troops in Syria to help shore up the rule of President Bashar al-Assad.

There were no immediate reports of casualties. ByEuan Ward reporting from Beirut, Lebanon The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah fired one of its heaviest rocket barrages yet into Israel on Wednesday, targeting military bases and an arms factory, in response to an overnight strike thatkilled one of its senior commandersas tensions rise further at the border. The commander, Taleb Abdallah, also known as Abu Taleb, was among the highest-ranking members of Hezbollah, apowerful Lebanese militia and political movementbacked by Iran, to have been killed since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel set off war in Gaza. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the Hezbollah rocket barrages, according to the Israeli military. Israel and Hamas have been trading fire since Israel’s offensive in the Gaza Strip prompted Hezbollah to mount cross-border attacks in support of Hamas, but the intensity of Hezbollah’s attacks has increased this month. Israeli officials have threatened at the highest levels to pursue further military action and Hezbollah has vowed to keep up its fight, raising fresh concerns that the months of low-level conflict could grow into a larger war on Israel’s northern border. Speaking at Mr. Abdallah’s funeral in Beirut’s southern suburbs, Hashem Safieddine, the leader of Hezbollah’s executive council, pledged that the group would double down on its attacks against Israel in the wake of the killing. “If the enemy’s message is to retreat from our position in supporting the oppressed in Gaza, then he must know that our answer is final,” Mr. Safieddine said. “We will increase the intensity, quantity and quality of our operations.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMichael Crowley reporting from Washington Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken plans to visit Israel and three Arab states next week, as the U.S. presses for a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas to end the war in Gaza. Mr. Blinken is scheduled to travel to Israel, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan from Monday through Wednesday, Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesman, said in a statement on Friday. The trip, which will be his eighth visit to the region since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks that set off the war, comes at a particularly tense moment. The Biden administration is trying hard to stop the fighting in Gaza in hopes of freeing Israeli — and some Israeli-American — hostages held by Hamas and ending a conflict that has exacted a grievous toll in lives, physically devastated most of Gaza and created political pressure on President Biden to restrict U.S. arms deliveries to Israel. Relations between the Biden administration and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel are particularly fraught in the wake of Mr. Biden’s decision to hold up the delivery of American 2,000-pound bombs, a move meant to ensure that they are not used in the sort of “full-scale invasion” of the Gazan city of Rafah that Mr. Biden has said he opposes. Mr. Blinken’s travels also come as worries are rising that fighting might escalate along Israel’s northern border with the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran. The exchanges of fire have prompted evacuations on both sides of the border. A cease-fire would “unlock the possibility of achieving calm along Israel’s northern border — so both displaced Israeli and Lebanese families can return to their homes,” Mr. Miller’s statement said. Qatar and Egypt have each played roles as mediators between Hamas and Israel, which do not negotiate directly. Israel recently strained relations with Egypt byseizing “tactical control” of a buffer zone on the Egypt-Gaza border, known as the Philadelphi Corridor. In Jordan, Mr. Blinken is expected to attend a conference on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza co-hosted by Jordan, Egypt, and the United Nations.

ByEphrat Livni Israel’s Parliament on Tuesday voted to revive a bill that would enable ultra-Orthodox men to be drafted into the military, a divisive issue that has become especially contentious since the war in Gaza began last October. The vote, which passed 63-57, was a procedural step aimed at keeping the hot-button issue in the hands of legislators instead of judges, who have repeatedly determined thatthe exemption, dating to the founding of Israel, should not stand. Many secular Israelis have long lamented the draft exemptions for the most religious members of society. The issue has taken new prominence since the Hamas-led attack in Israel on Oct. 7 set off a war that has prompted repeated call-ups of reserve soldiers. The bill, which revives a proposal made in 2022, would limit the exemption for young ultra-Orthodox men enrolled in religious study, establish recruitment quotas for them and provide alternative service options, among other changes. Some critics contend, however, that the proposal would not significantly increase military service among the ultra-Orthodox, known in Hebrew as Haredim. The bill was advanced in May by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in an apparent effort to deter Israel’s Supreme Court from taking the lead on the matter.The justices are currently considering whether the government must immediately begin drafting the ultra-Orthodox, following the expiration of a law last year that was temporarily extended and has expired again. The vote on Tuesday was widely seen as intended to send a signal to the court that the Knesset was addressing the issue. The court ordered the government to address it long ago, but years of legislative efforts have failed to produce meaningful change. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Thousands marched, and with many streets blocked off, there were few protesters. ByChelsia Rose Marcius,Maia ColemanandErin Nolan Thousands of supporters of Israel marched along Fifth Avenue on Sunday during a heavily policed Israel Day parade that took on a more somber tone this year as the war in Gaza enters its eighth month. The normally jubilant event, which has been held annually since 1964, had fewer spectators in Midtown Manhattan than usual because of intense security. The parade — expected to draw 40,000 participants, all of whom needed credentials to march — has been previously called “Celebrate Israel.” This year, it was renamed “Israel Day on 5th” and focused on remembering the hostages seized by Hamas on Oct. 7. The event was mostly peaceful and drew very few protesters. Police barricades, chain-link fences and checkpoints limited access to the route. New York has had roughly 3,000 demonstrations related to the Israel-Hamas war since October, according to Mayor Eric Adams, most of them pro-Palestinian, and hundreds of protesters have been arrested. No Palestinian flags were in evidence along the parade route on Sunday. Still, moments of tension erupted between participants and politicians. At the start of the parade, the arrival of elected officials, including Gov. Kathy Hochul; Letitia James, the attorney general of New York; and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, drew jeers from the crowd. As Mr. Schumer began to speak, at least one person shouted “you betrayed us,” a reference to Mr. Schumer’ssharp criticism of the Israeli governmentin a Senate speech in March.

ByNicholas Fandos Roughly four years ago, Mondaire Jones and Jamaal Bowmanmade historytogether. Young, left-leaning Democrats, they won hard-fought primaries in neighboring districts to become the first Black men ever to represent New York’s Westchester County in Congress. Now, they find themselves deeply at odds over theIsrael-Hamas war, a break so sharp that Mr. Jones vowed on Monday to help defeat Mr. Bowman in the Democratic primary on June 25 and endorse his opponent, George Latimer. It was the latest sign of how intensely the conflict in the Middle East has come to divide Democratic politics this election year. Mr. Latimer and Mr. Bowman have already spent months debating the conflict, and the race has been transformed by $10 million in outside spending by pro-Israel interest groups on Mr. Latimer’s behalf. Mr. Jones said in an interview that he could not sit by while Mr. Bowman positioned himself as a leading critic of Israel, saying that his former ally had sown “pain and anxiety” among Jewish New Yorkers and had torn “at the fabric of our community and our civil rights coalition.” But Mr. Jones also may be considering his own political self-interest. Afterlosing his House seatin 2022, he isnow runningto unseat Representative Mike Lawler, a Republican, in a swing district just to the north. Creating some distance from Mr. Bowman may help win over Jewish voters, as well as other moderate voters. “As someone who is among the most popular Democrats in the Hudson Valley, it is my prerogative to play a dispositive role in ending this long, painful nightmare that we have been experiencing since Oct. 7,” Mr. Jones said.

ByRobert Jimison Reporting from the Capitol The House voted mostly along party lines on Tuesday to impose sweeping sanctions on officials at the International Criminal Court in a rebuke of efforts by the court’s top prosecutor tocharge top Israeli leaderswith war crimes in connection with the offensive against Hamas. The bill would compel President Biden to restrict entry into the United States, revoke visas and impose financial restrictions on anyone at the court involved in trying to investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute “protected persons,” or allies of the United States. It would also target anyone who provides “financial, material or technological support” to those efforts. Mr. Biden’s advisers said he was “strongly opposed” to the measure because it would impose sanctions on such a broad swath of officials, including court staff members and any witnesses involved in a potential case. But it reflected broad bipartisan anger in Washington after the court’s top prosecutor announced late last month that he wouldseek charges against both Israeli and Hamas leaders. The G.O.P.-written bill passed by a vote of 247 to 155, with two Republicans voting present and 42 Democrats crossing party lines in support. Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas and the author of the bill, said it was a necessary step to stop the international court from acting beyond its jurisdiction and to address fears that actions taken against Israeli officials could be a prelude to actions against American officials. “What happens here is going to be coming at us and our country,” Mr. Roy said on Tuesday. “That’s why it’s important to speak with one voice, with authority, with force.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByVivian Yee,Emad MekayandIsabel Kershner Reporting from Cairo and Jerusalem For weeks, talk show hosts and newspaper columnists across Egypt’s government-managed media spoke with one voice: Any Israeli “occupation” of a buffer zone on the Egypt-Gaza border could violate Egypt’s sovereignty and national security. That would deal a further blow to a relationship that Israel’s offensive had already pushed to its lowest point in decades. But when Israel’s military said last week that it had taken “tactical control” of the zone, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, the same government mouthpieces were quick to say that the area had nothing to do with Egypt. Sovereignty went unmentioned. It was the latest indication that for all the hard feelings and security fears provoked by Israel’s devastating campaign in the Gaza Strip, Cairo sees little choice but to protect its 1979 peace treaty with Israel. The accord has generated valuable military and intelligence cooperation against Egyptian insurgents and natural gas imports from Israel, as well as a close relationship with the United States and billions of dollars in American aid. For Israel, too, the “cold peace” with Egypt has been an essential pillar of national security for 45 years. It has given Israel a path to better relations with Arab countries, some of which have normalized their ties, making Israel an increasingly integral part of a regional, anti-Iranian axis. For the same reasons, the United States also considers the treaty, which grew out of the Camp David Accords, crucial to regional stability. Still, Israel took the risk of upsetting that delicate balance, saying that it must control the narrow buffer zone between Gaza and Egypt for its own security. Israel says it needs to destroy dozens of tunnels under the border that have enabled Hamas to smuggle in arms — despite Egypt’s avowals that had stopped the smuggling years ago.

ByBilal ShbairandErika Solomon Bilal Shbair reported from central Gaza. As dawn broke on Thursday, Haitham Abu Ammar combed through the rubble of the school that had become a shelter to him and thousands of other displaced Gazans. For hours, he helped people piece together the limbs of the ones they loved. “The most painful thing I have ever experienced was picking up those pieces of flesh with my hands,” said Mr. Abu Ammar, a 27-year-old construction worker. “I never thought I would have to do such a thing.” Early on Thursday, Israeli airstrikes hit the school complex, killing dozens of people — among them at least nine militants, the Israeli military said. Over the course of the day, corpses and mangled limbs recovered from the rubble were wrapped in blankets, stacked in truck beds and driven to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, the last major medical facility still operating in central Gaza. Israel’s military described the airstrike as painstakingly planned. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told reporters that Israeli forces had tracked the militants in the school-turned-shelter for three days before opening fire. “The Israeli military and the Shin Bet found a solution to separate the terrorists from those seeking shelter,” he said.

ByAdam RasgonandIsabel Kershner Reporting from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem In the months after he was taken hostage in Israel and hidden in the Gaza Strip, Andrey Kozlov’s captors kept drumming in the same message: The world, they said, had given up on him. Even his family had moved on. “Your mom is on vacation in Greece,” the militants told him. “Your mom doesn’t know about you at all — and doesn’t want to know.” So persuasive were they that when Israeli security forces burst through the door of the apartment where Mr. Kozlov was being held on Saturday, he was at first unsure of whether they had come to save or kill him, his parents said in an interview this week during which they recounted his ordeal. The account of Mr. Kozlov’s eight months in captivity came as a doctor in Israel reported that while he and the three other rescued Hamas hostages seemed to be in fairly good condition at first glance, tests showed that all were malnourished. And all, said Dr. Itai Pessach, the head of the medical team for returning hostages at Sheba Medical Center, had suffered mistreatment in varying degrees of frequency and intensity. “They were all abused, punished and tortured physically and psychologically in many ways,” he said. Dr. Pessach said the hostages he had examined had lost a lot of weight, though they gained some back, and their muscles were “extremely wasted.” The mix of poor nutrition, confinement, lack of sunlight and stress that they endured may have long-term implications for their health, he added. Hamas says it has treated the hostages well compared with Israel’s treatment of Palestinian prisoners, a claim that Israeli officials deny. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The attack appeared to have hit a market. ByRaja Abdulrahim The Israeli operation to rescue four hostages in the town of Nuseirat in central Gaza on Saturday unleashed a heavy aerial bombardment and ground operations that killed more than 200 people, according to two hospital officials in the area. Residents there said it was the heaviest onslaught they could recall during the eight-month-old war. One hospital official said Israel struck a busy market, and video footage from the immediate aftermath of the attack showed bloodied bodies on the ground in what appeared to be a market that was struck. Other video footage showed people running for cover as a powerful airstrike exploded near them. Dr. Khalil Daqran, the spokesman for Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, and Marwan Abu Nasser, the acting administrative director of Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat, said their two hospitals had received a total of more than 200 dead and many of the wounded from the attack on Saturday. Many of those killed were women and children, the hospital officials said. Israel’s military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, estimated the number of casualties to be under 100, without specifying whether these were dead or wounded or both. The New York Times could not independently verify the death toll and it was not clear how many were civilians and how many were Hamas militants. Hours later some of the dead had already been buried by their families while others had yet to be claimed, according to Dr. Daqran. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMatthew Mpoke Bigg Following the Israeli rescue of four hostages in Gaza on Saturday, Israel’s military said that three of them had been held in the home of a member of Hamas, which it said showed that the armed group was using civilian homes to shield its activity. Israeli special forces, backed by the military, intelligence and air force, raided two buildings in a neighborhood in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza on Saturday, rescuing Almog Meir Jan, 22; Andrey Kozlov, 27; and Shlomi Ziv, 41, from the home of Abdallah Aljamal, the military said. A fourth hostage, Noa Argamani, 26, was also freed, apparently from a nearby building. More than 274 people were killed during the raid, according to Gaza’s health ministry. The Israeli military said that the death toll was less than 100. Neither the Israeli military nor Palestinian health officials provided a breakdown of civilians and combatants killed in the raid. Mr. Aljamal’s death was confirmed by Gaza’s Government Media Office on Sunday, which said he had worked for the Hamas-affiliated news agency, Palestine Now. On Sunday, the Israeli military said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app: “The hostages were held captive by Abdallah Aljamal and members of his family in their home. This isfurther evidenceof the deliberate use of civilian homes and buildings by the Hamas terrorist organization to hold Israeli hostages captive in the Gaza Strip.” Israel’s military has said for months that civilian casualties in Gaza are inevitable because Hamas hides its forces within the population.

ByAnushka Patil The Israeli military said on Monday that four more hostages who were abducted in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks had died months ago in Gaza, a disclosure that was likely to add pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to move forward with a cease-fire deal. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, spokesman for the Israeli military, said at a news briefing on Monday that the four hostages were believed to have been killed together “several months ago” near Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, while Israeli forces were operating in the area. The military identified the men as Haim Perry, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper and Nadav Popplewell. Admiral Hagari said the decision to announce the hostages’ deaths on Monday was based on “additional intelligence, which had been verified recently, making it possible to determine today that the four are no longer alive,” adding that he knew “difficult questions” would arise about the circumstances of their deaths. The families of the four had been notified that their bodies were being held by Hamas, and the circumstances of their deaths were “still under examination,” the Israeli military said. The Hostages Families Forum, a support group, released a statement demanding that the Israeli government immediately negotiate a deal for the remaining hostages to be freed. It said the four who were declared dead on Monday were alive when they were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nirim and Kibbutz Nir Oz, and that there had been “signs of life” in the interim period. “Their murder in captivity is a mark of disgrace and a sad reflection on the significance of delaying previous deals,” the group said. The pressure on Mr. Netanyahu to end the fighting in Gaza has grown since last week, when President Biden publicly endorsed what he said was a three-phase cease-fire proposal put forward by Israel. But Mr. Netanyahu’s far-right political allies havethreatened to collapse his governmentif Israel makes any agreement that ends the war without eliminating Hamas.

18 Arrested at Israeli Nationalist Flag March Through East Jerusalem,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/middleeast/israeli-palestinian-jerusalem-flag-march.html,2024-06-05T18:41:09+0000,The annual march celebrating Israel’s 1967 takeover of the mostly Palestinian East Jerusalem has long been a flashpoint.,"Tens of thousands of Jewish Israelis joined an annual nationalist march on Wednesday through the heart of Jerusalem to celebrate Israel’s 1967 capture of the city’s eastern half, with some chanting extremist slogans calling for violence against Arabs.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement The annual march celebrating Israel’s 1967 takeover of the mostly Palestinian East Jerusalem has long been a flashpoint. ByAaron Boxerman reporting from Jerusalem Tens of thousands of Jewish Israelis joined an annual nationalist march on Wednesday through the heart of Jerusalem to celebrate Israel’s 1967 capture of the city’s eastern half, with some chanting extremist slogans calling for violence against Arabs. The rally, known as the Dance of the Flags or the Flag March, has long been a flashpoint for tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, but security forces were especially worried the event could spark violence this year because of the eight-month-long war between Israel and Hamas, and a steep rise in violence on the West Bank. The march winds through Jerusalem’s Old City toward the Western Wall, one of Judaism’s holiest sites. Chanting, dancing and waving blue-and-white Israeli flags, the marchers made their way through the Old City’s Damascus Gate into largely Palestinian areas of Jerusalem’s Old City. The marchers banged on the shutters of shops closed by Palestinian owners who feared attacks and chanted slogans that included “may your village burn down” and a biblical verse tweaked to call for “revenge on Palestine.” The Israeli police said they arrested 13 people “involved in various violent incidents” in the Old City. Some of the Israelis attending the march also hurled bottles and jeered at journalists from Arabic news outlets, who were watching the area from a designated platform. Officers later moved in after the bottle-throwing continued, detaining five more people, the police said. When asked about the violence against journalists, Matthew Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said: “Attacks of that nature should be prevented when possible. When they can’t be prevented they should be fully prosecuted, people should be held accountable under the law.” The demonstrators included many younger Jewish Israelis, wearing clothing emblazoned with the slogans of the religious right’s high schools and military academies.

ByChristiaan TriebertandNeil Collier At least one bomb used in the Israeli strike that killed dozens of people, including women and children, in a United Nations school building on Thursday appeared to have been made in the United States, according to a weapons expert and videos reviewed by The New York Times. The school, located in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, was beingused as a shelter for thousands of displaced Palestinians. The Israeli military said it had targeted classrooms that were occupied by Palestinian militants, though it did not provide evidence for this claim. A video of munitions debris,filmedby the Palestinian journalist Emad Abu Shawiesh, shows remnants of a GBU-39 bomb, which is designed and manufactured by Boeing. The use of this weapon in the strike wasfirst reported by CNN. The footage was uploaded to Instagram shortly after 4 a.m. in Gaza on Thursday, about two and a half hours after the strike wasreportedon Telegram, a messaging app. The Times, using details seen in videos, confirmed the weapon debris was filmed at the U.N. school. Trevor Ball, a former U.S. Army explosive ordnance disposal technician,identifiedthe part of the weapon seen in the footage as the nose of a GBU-39. “This distinct nose is unique to the GBU-39 munition series, and, due to its solid construction,it can survive the blast intact,” he said. The holes visible across several floors of the U.N. compound also suggest the use of a smaller precision-guided munition like the GBU-39, Mr. Ball added.

Gazan health authorities said that many women and children were among the dozens killed. ByBilal Shbair,Aaron Boxerman,Erika SolomonandAbu Bakr Bashir A day after Israeli forcesbombed a U.N. school complexin central Gaza that had become a shelter for displaced Palestinians, some of the facts remain unclear or under contention. Israel said it struck three classrooms used by 20 to 30 Palestinian militants, including some who participated in the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, and that it was unaware of civilian casualties. Gazan health authorities said that among the dozens of people killed, many were children and women. Here is what we know and do not know. The multistory building was one of several that made up the UNRWA Nuseirat Boys’ Preparatory School. It was one of the many schools in Gaza run by the main U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees and their descendants. Like all ofthe territory’s schools, it stopped operating as a school in October, after Hamas led an assault on Israel, and Israel began its retaliatory bombing campaign. And like many of them, it became crowded with people who, displaced by the war from homes in other parts of Gaza, sought shelter in schools, hospitals and other institutions they hoped would be less likely to be bombed. Philippe Lazzarini, the director of the U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees, said 6,000 people had been living in the school. About three-quarters of Gaza’s roughly 2.2 million people have fled their homes, many of them multiple times. The Israeli military has referred to the school in Nuseirat as a militant base, saying that fighters for Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad used three of its classrooms to plan and conduct operations against Israel.

"In Israel and Ukraine, Biden Navigates Two of America’s Most Difficult Allies",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/us/politics/biden-israel-ukraine.html,2024-06-04T00:12:58+0000,President Biden has promised to support the two countries for as long as it takes.

Both their wars appear to be at critical turning points. ByDavid E. Sanger Reporting from Washington Over the past five days, President Biden has been engaged in a very public demonstration of the struggles of managing two of America’s most difficult allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, both leading countries that the president has vowed to defend, as long as it takes. The conflicts they are engaged in could not be more different, born out of grievances that reach back decades. But by coincidence, both confrontations seem to be at critical turning points, that moment when it becomes obvious how starkly national interests are diverging — to say nothing of the political interests of three leaders clearly worried about their own hold on power. Adding to the complexity of the problem, it is unclear in Washington exactly what an acceptable endgame might look in Ukraine or in Gaza. Officially, Ukraine still talks about total victory, pushing Russia out of every inch of territory it seized since the February 2022 invasion. Israel still speaks of the goal of the “total destruction” of Hamas, the only way to assure that it could never again mount an attack like the Oct. 7 assault that killed nearly 1,200 Israelis and sparked seven months of brutal retaliation. But in Washington, those rallying calls sound increasingly unrealistic. Russia appears to be regaining momentum. The call for the total defeat of Hamas sounds like a rationale for perpetual war — and, in fact, Israeli officials have publicly declared the war in Gaza will likely continue to the end of the year, if not longer. So Mr. Biden has taken to crisis management, trying to prevent the worst, even if he cannot answer the question of how, exactly, these wars end. “Neither Ukraine nor Israel is a treaty ally,” said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a longtime Mideast negotiator. He was referring to the status of the other 31 members of NATO, which are obliged to come to one another’s defense, and the formal American pacts with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and others. “And yet we are fully invested in how to get these wars to the next phase, a phase where we lessen the violence, even if we can’t articulate a realistic vision of how it stops.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

BySharon Otterman The website of the Columbia Law Review, one of the United States’ most prestigious student-edited law journals, was taken offline Monday by its board of directors after its editors published anarticlethat argues Palestinians are living under a “brutally sophisticated structure of oppression” by Israel that amounts to a crime against humanity. As of Tuesday evening, visitors to thewebsiteof the 123-year-old journal saw only a blank page with the message “Website is under maintenance.” The decision to suspend access to the website is the latest example of how American universities have sought to regulate expression that is highly critical of Israel amid concerns that it veers into antisemitism. That, in turn, has spurred complaints about censorship and academic freedom when it comes to Palestinian scholarship. In a statement, theboard of directors, which consists of faculty members and alumni, said it had decided to suspend the website on Monday after learning two days earlier that not all of the students on the Law Review had read the essay before publication. The board said that it had asked the editors to hold the article until June 7, to give others time to read it but that they had published it on Monday instead. The board then decided to take the website down temporarily “to provide time for the Law Review to determine how to proceed.” In a letter Tuesday to the editorial staff that was provided to The New York Times, the board charged that the article had been handled with unusual secrecy, calling that “unacceptable.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByFarnaz FassihiandAaron Boxerman The United Nations will add Israel, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad to a list of countries and armed groups that harm children when it releases its annual report on children and armed conflict, citing the heavy toll the war in Gaza has taken on minors, including killing, maiming and starvation, U.N. officials said. Stéphane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said the body’s chief of staff called the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, on Friday to inform him that Israel would be listed this year. “The call was a courtesy afforded to countries that are newly listed,” Mr. Dujarric said, “to give countries a heads-up and avoid leaks.” Hamas, the armed group that led Gaza before the war, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the second-largest armed group in the enclave, will be named in the report. Hamas is being cited because its fighters abducted and killed Israeli children when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7, a U.N. official said. Armed groups that harm children in conflicts, like the Taliban and Boko Haram, are routinely named in the annual report. The news of Israel’s listing further strained an already deteriorating relationship between it and the United Nations. Mr. Erdan called the move “an immoral decision that aids terrorism and rewards terrorists.” He made a video recording of the phone call andreleased parts of it on the social media site X. Mr. Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, called the release of a recording of the telephone call “shocking and unacceptable and something I’ve never seen in my 25 years serving this organization.” The United Nations’ special representative for children and armed conflict prepares the yearly report under a mandate from the General Assembly and the Security Council. The report will be presented to members of the Council next Friday and released publicly on June 18, Mr. Dujarric said. The Council will have an open debate about the report’s findings later this month. During Hamas’s terrorist attack on Oct. 7, armed men kidnapped children, some of them toddlers and babies, and held them hostage in Gaza. Children were also among the roughly 1,200 Israelis and foreigners killed. Israel’s retaliatory bombing campaign and ground war in Gaza has killed at least 36,000 people, Gazan health officials say, a large portion of them women and children. The United Nations has said that children in Gaza also face famine and starvation because Israel has restricted humanitarian aid. Many children have also lost limbs or been gravely wounded in other ways. Majed Bamya, the Palestinian deputy ambassador to the United Nations,said in a post on X,“Israeli ministers are the only ones surprised of such a development (list will be released next week) after the killing and maiming of so many Palestinian children.” Farnaz Fassihiis the United Nations bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the organization, and also covers Iran and the shadow war between Iran and Israel.

ByAaron Boxerman,Raja AbdulrahimandThomas Fuller The Israeli military said on Friday that its forces had advanced into central Rafah, pushing even more deeply into the southern Gaza city despite an international backlash and pressure from allies to scale back the latest offensive and agree to a cease-fire. Israeli special forces were engaging in “intelligence-based targeted raids” in central Rafah, the Israeli military said in a statement. It added that troops were performing “focused and low-intensity operations” in the city. On Wednesday, the military announced that it had established “operational control” over the border zone with Egypt, an eight-mile-long strip known as the Philadelphi Corridor on the outskirts of Rafah. Commercially available satellite imagery taken by Planet Labs on Thursday showed that the Israeli military had set up positions in parts of central Rafah, while military vehicles and tanks could be seen as far as the outskirts of the Tel al-Sultan area in western Rafah. As the fighting raged in Gaza, President Biden said Friday in Washington that it was time to end the war and bring about a cease-fire. “At this point, Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another Oct. 7,” Mr. Biden said from the White House. “It’s time for this war to end, for the day after to begin.” In a statement released after Mr. Biden’s comments, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said “the war will not end until all of its goals are achieved, including the return of all our abductees and the elimination of Hamas’s military and governmental capabilities.” Despite nearly eight months of fighting, Israel has yet to accomplish its stated goals of toppling Hamas and bringing home the roughly 125 remaining hostages abducted during the Oct. 7 attack. Israeli officials have said that shutting down Hamas’s cross-border smuggling network and rooting out militants in Rafah will be key steps toward those goals.

ByCassandra Vinograd,Hiba YazbekandThomas Fuller Israel’s military said it was pressing on with its ground assault in the southern Gaza Strip on Tuesday despite mountinginternational outrageover its operations there, including an airstrike over the weekend that killed dozens of civilians. The military said its troops were engaging in close-quarters combat with Hamas fighters and that it had deployed an additional “combat team” to Rafah, without specifying how many more soldiers were sent to the southern city. The military has said that its strike on Rafah on Sunday — which ignited a deadly fire that killed at least 45 people — targeted a Hamas compound. On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said it was a “tragic accident” that civilians in the camp, many of them displaced from other parts of Gaza, had been killed. His comments, however, did little to quell a chorus of voices demanding accountability and a halt to the fighting, which came amid reports of anotherdeadly strikein nearby Al-Mawasi on Tuesday. An official in Gaza, Dr. Mohammed Al Moghayer of the Palestinian Civil Defense, said that at least 21 people were killed and dozens injured on Tuesday when strikes hit tents housing displaced people in Al-Mawasi, not far from the city of Rafah. Israel has declared an area of Al-Mawasi a humanitarian safe zone. Tuesday’s strike appeared to occur near the humanitarian zone but not in it, according to videos verified by The New York Times.

Hamas says it wants a cease-fire. This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it. Hamas needs to take the deal. For months, people all over the world have called for cease-fire. Now it’s time to raise your voices and demand that Hamas come to the table, agrees to this deal and ends this war that they began. At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another Oct. 7. And the Palestinian people have endured sheer hell in this war. Too many innocent people have been killed, including thousands of children. It’s time to begin this new stage. The hostages come home, for Israel to be secure, for the suffering to stop. It’s time for this war to end, and for the day after to begin. Thank you very much. ByZolan Kanno-YoungsandDavid E. Sanger Zolan Kanno-Youngs reported from Rehoboth Beach, Del., where President Biden will be spending the weekend. David E. Sanger reported from Washington. Declaring Hamas no longer capable of carrying out a major terrorist attack on Israel, President Biden said on Friday that it was time for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and endorsed a new plan he said Israel had offered to win the release of hostages and end the fighting. “It’s time for this war to end, for the day after to begin,” Mr. Biden said, speaking from the State Dining Room at the White House. He also gave a stark description of Hamas’s diminished capabilities after more than seven months of Israeli attacks, saying that “at this point, Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another Oct. 7.” “This is truly a decisive moment,” Mr. Biden said. “Israel has made their proposal. Hamas says it wants a cease-fire. This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it.” With that statement, Mr. Biden appeared to be revealing his true agenda: making public elements of the proposal in an effort to pressure both Hamas and Israel to break out of a monthslong deadlock that has resulted in the killing of thousands of Palestinians. American officials have describedHamas’s leader, Yahya Sinwar, as interested only in his own survival and that of his family and inner circle, as they presumably operate from tunnels deep under southern Gaza. But officials have also said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has little incentive to move to a real cease-fire, because of the widespread belief in Israel that as soon as the surviving hostages are returned, and a last cease-fire begins, he will most likely lose his fragile hold on power. Mr. Biden’s remarks came at a pivotal moment in his re-election campaign, a day after his rival, former President Donald J. Trump, was convicted of 34 felony charges. At the same time, he has been facing growing pressure at home over the bloodshed in Gaza, which has led to eruptions on college campuses and on the streets of American cities, and alienated many of his own supporters.

A Small American Bomb Killing Palestinians by the Dozen in Gaza,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/world/middleeast/us-israel-bomb-gbu39-gaza.html,2024-06-08T09:04:26+0000,The GBU-39 is increasingly the weapon of choice for the Israeli military and was used in two recent mass-casualty events.,"An American-made, precision guided bomb that homes in on specific targets and, ideally, limits civilian casualties, was used in airstrikes in Gaza that killed dozens of Palestinians, including women and children.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by The GBU-39 is increasingly the weapon of choice for the Israeli military and was used in two recent mass-casualty events. ByLara Jakes Lara Jakes writes about weapons and military aid to conflict zones. An American-made, precision guided bomb that homes in on specific targets and, ideally, limits civilian casualties, was used in airstrikes in Gaza that killed dozens of Palestinians, including women and children. The weapon,the GBU-39,or small-diameter bomb,was used in an attackat a former United Nations school on Thursday and in aMay 26 strike in Rafah. In both cases, the Israeli military defended its actions, saying the strikes were aimed at militants using civilians as human shields. The Gaza health authorities said that civilians had also been killed, and there were videos and pictures of women and children among the dead. Two weapons experts told The New York Times that Israel has appeared to increase the use of the bombs since the start of this year, compared with the war’s earliest days, when it launched them in only 10 percent of airstrikes against Gaza. As a recent spate of Israeli strikes demonstrates, even a relatively diminutive bomb can inflict severe civilian casualties. “The thing is, even using a smaller weapon, or using a precision guided weapon, doesn’t mean you don’t kill civilians, and it doesn’t mean that all of your strikes are suddenly lawful,” said Brian Castner, a weapons expert at Amnesty International. Early in the war, the Israeli military mounted full-scale invasions of Gazan cities with tanks, artillery and 2,000-pound bombs, earning it international condemnation for heavy civilian casualties.

U.N.

The draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 2735.” “Colleagues, the cease-fire deal would pave the way toward an enduring cessation of hostilities and a better future for all. As President Biden acknowledged just the other day, the Palestinian people have endured sheer hell in this war started by Hamas. There’s an opportunity to chart a different course.” ByFarnaz Fassihi,Michael Crowley,Mike IvesandThomas Fuller The United Nations Security Council on Monday adopted a U.S.-backed cease-fire plan for the Gaza Strip with only Russia abstaining, a sign of the growing frustration among the world’s major powers over the war and the desire to bring it to an end. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told members of the Security Council that Israel had already agreed to the deal laid out in the resolution — although Israel has so far resisted taking a public position on it — and she urged Hamas “to do the same.” “Hamas can now see that the international community is united, united behind a deal that will save lives and help Palestinian civilians in Gaza start to rebuild and heal,” Ms. Thomas-Greenfield said. The 14-0 vote may strengthen the hand of Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who returned to the Middle East on Monday to press Hamas and Israel to agree to a cease-fire. But in a sign of the difficulties facing Mr. Blinken and other mediators in achieving a final deal, Israel’s representative to the U.N., Reut Shapir Ben-Naftaly, did not say that Israel had accepted the terms of the cease-fire plan. She said that her country’s goals in the war had not changed and that it would use military operations to free hostages,as it did just two days ago. “We will continue until all of the hostages are returned and Hamas’s military capabilities are dismantled,” Ms. Shapir Ben-Naftaly told the Council. She said if Hamas leaders freed all hostages and turned themselves in, “not one shot would be fired.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMarc Tracy Hundreds of people protested against Israel on Monday night outside an exhibition in Lower Manhattan that commemorates the more than 360 people who were killed by Hamas on Oct. 7 at a rave in southern Israel, prompting strong condemnations from public officials. The location of the demonstration — outside an exhibition featuring portraits of the people killed at the Tribe of Novatrance music festival, along with cars that were charred in the attack and the personal belongings that some music fans left behind — was widely criticized from the city government to Washington. Mayor Eric Adams of New York visited the exhibition on Tuesday and called the protest “despicable.” And Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement Tuesday, “The events at yesterday’s memorial to those murdered at the Nova music festival are outrageous and heartbreaking.” One of the exhibition’s American organizers, Scooter Braun — a powerful music executive who was instrumental in the rise of Justin Bieber — said on Tuesday that the exhibition, “October 7th 06:29 AM — The Moment Music Stood Still,” had been extended a week, until June 22. “For those who chose to protest against innocent music lovers who were murdered … WE WILL DANCE AGAIN,” Mr. Braun,the chief executive of the music conglomerate Hybe America, said in a statement. The protesters gathered Monday evening steps away from the New York Stock Exchange building in Lower Manhattan, lit flares and repeated shouts including “Long live the intifada” and “Israel, go to hell,” according tovideos posted to social media.

ByAaron BoxermanandThomas Fuller When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel announced plans late last year to occupy a sensitive corridor of land in the Gaza Strip, along the border with Egypt, the response from Cairo was public, explicit and ominous. “It must be strictly emphasized that any Israeli move in this direction will lead to a serious threat to Egyptian-Israeli relations,” the Egyptian government said in a statement in English in January, weeks after Mr. Netanyahu announced plans to occupy the so-called Philadelphi Corridor. Egypt said that an Israeli military presence therewould violate the 1979 peacetreaty between the two countries. This week, the Israeli military announced that it had seized “tactical control” of the corridor. Yet despite the Egyptian government facing domestic pressure to take a harsher stance on Israel following its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, there has been no public Egyptian comment on the seizure of the corridor. The silence may be a reflection of the dilemma Egypt finds itself in after nearly eight months of war in Gaza. Egypt and Israel view their relationship as a cornerstone of their national security, according to former Israeli and Egyptian officials, making it unlikely the Egyptian government would take substantial steps against Israel. Peace between Egypt and Israel has been an anchor of Middle East stability for 45 years. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

ByMaggie Astor Nikki Haley, the former Republican presidential candidate and U.N. ambassador during the Trump administration, wrote “Finish them” on an artillery shell in Israel this week. Danny Danon, Israel’s former ambassador to the United Nations and a member of the Israeli Parliament,shared a photoon social media on Tuesday showing Ms. Haley signing the shell. Her visit came just days after Israel drew international condemnation for a strikethat killed dozens of Gazan civiliansin a camp for displaced Palestinians. “This is what my friend, the former ambassador Nikki Haley, wrote today on a shell during a visit to an artillery post on the northern border,” Mr. Danon wrote, declaring of the Israeli military, “The I.D.F. will win!” Ms. Haley finished her inscription with a note that “America loves Israel always,” using a heart emoji for “loves.” She signed the artillery shell not along the Gaza frontier, in the south, but near Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, with which Israel also has a longstanding conflict. She also visited a kibbutz where Israelis were killed on Oct. 7, and her public remarks focused on Gaza.

ByRobin Stein,Christiaan TriebertandHaley Willis The bombs used in the Israeli strike thatkilled dozens of Palestiniansin a camp for displaced people in Rafah on Sunday were made in the United States, according to weapons experts and visual evidence reviewed by The New York Times. Munition debris filmed at the strike location the next day was remnants from a GBU-39, a bomb designed and manufactured in the United States, The Times found. U.S. officials have been pushing Israel to use more of this type of bomb, which they say can reduce civilian casualties. The key detail in the weapon debris was the tail actuation system, which controls the fins that guide the GBU-39 to a target, according to Trevor Ball, a former U.S. Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, whoearlier identified the weapon on X. The weapon’s unique bolt pattern and slot where the folding fins are stowed were clearly visible in the debris, Mr. Ball said. The munition fragments, filmed by Alam Sadeq, a Palestinian journalist, are also marked by a series of numbers beginning with “81873.” This is the unique identifier code assigned by the U.S. government to Woodward, an aerospace manufacturer based in Colorado that supplies parts for bombs including the GBU-39. At least 45 people in Kuwaiti Al-Salam Camp 1, which was built in early January, were killed by the blast and subsequent fires, according to the Gazan Health Ministry. More than 240 were wounded.

ByAdam Rasgon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel maneuvered into rougher political waters on Monday, as two far-right partners threatened to bring down his government should Israel agree to a cease-fire deal that would end the war in Gaza without eliminating Hamas. Mr. Netanyahu told lawmakers in a closed-door meeting on Monday that President Biden had not presented the “whole picture” when he described a proposed cease-fire from the White House last week, according to a person who attended the meeting and requested anonymity. Mr. Netanyahu, however, expressed openness to a 42-day pause in the fighting, the person said, embracing at least part of the first phase of the three-part cease-fire plan. Mr. Biden called the three-phase proposal, which he said was put forward by Israel, a road map to an “enduring cease-fire” and to the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. If Hamas abided by the agreement’s terms, the president said, it would ultimately lead to the “cessation of hostilities permanently.” “It’s time to end this war,” Mr. Biden said Two-far-right members of Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, said on Monday that they could not accept any deal that stops short of completely eliminating Hamas. As Mr. Biden described it on Friday, the Israeli military’s attacks in Gaza had already eliminated Hamas as a major threat, and that “at this point, Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another Oct. 7.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByAaron Boxerman,Gabby Sobelman,Erika SolomonandThomas Fuller Israel’s national security adviser said Wednesday that he expected military operations in Gaza to continue through at least the end of the year, appearing to dismiss the idea that the war could come to an end after the military offensive against Hamas in Rafah. “We expect another seven months of combat in order to shore up our achievement and realize what we define as the destruction of Hamas and Islamic Jihad’s military and governing capabilities,” Tzachi Hanegbi, the national security adviser, said in a radio interview with Kan, the Israeli public broadcaster. The Israeli military also said Wednesday that it had seized “operational control” over abuffer stripalong the southern edge of Gaza to prevent cross-border smuggling with Egypt that would allow Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups to rearm. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said repeatedly that controlling the corridor is critical for Israeli security in postwar Gaza. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, said the zone was “Hamas’s oxygen tube” and had been used by the Palestinian armed group for “smuggling munitions into Gazan territory on a regular basis.” He said that Hamas had also built tunnels near the Egyptian border, calculating that Israel would not dare strike so close to Egyptian territory. In recent months, Israeli defense officials have told the public to expect a protracted campaign in Gaza, although one that would progress in phases toward lower-intensity fighting. Still, Mr. Hanegbi’s assessment of at least another seven months of military operations appeared to be at odds with earlier projections by Mr. Netanyahu, who said in April that the country was “on the brink of victory” in its war against Hamas.

Is there a genocide in Gaza? ByDana GoldsteinandMarc Tracy Dana Goldstein, who covers education, reported from Atlanta. Marc Tracy, who covers cultural institutions, reported from New York. At a Holocaust museum in Atlanta, staff members had typically ended their tours by saying that many survivors of the death camps immigrated to Palestine. But after the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the guides noticed that some students would ask a simple but complicated question: Is this the Palestine that we’ve been hearing about? So staff members at the museum, the Breman, made a few changes, according to Rabbi Joseph Prass, the museum’s education director. Now, docents explain to visitors that many Holocaust survivors found refuge in “the British Mandate of Palestine” or “the area that would become the country of Israel.” Each year, roughly two dozen Holocaust museums in the United States teach millions of visitors — often students on field trips — about the Nazi genocide of six million Jews, a history that is fading from living memory. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel and the ensuing war, that mission has felt especially urgent, as the number of bias incidents against Jews has risen across the country.

ByIsabel Kershner Reporting from Jerusalem For months, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has refused to offer a timeline for ending the war against Hamas in Gaza, a stance his critics see as a political tactic. But he has been put on the spot by President Biden’s announcementoutlining a proposal for a truce. Mr. Netanyahu, a conservative, has long juggled competing personal, political and national interests. He now appears to be facing a stark choice between the survival of his hard-line, hawkish government and bringing home hostages held in Gaza while setting himself and Israel on a new course away from growing internationalisolation. Critics of the prime minister have portrayed him as indecisive and say there are two Netanyahus. One, they say, functions pragmatically in the small war cabinet he formed with some centrist rivals, to give it public legitimacy. The other is effectively being held hostage by the far-right members of his governing coalition, who oppose any concession to Hamas and who ensure his political survival. On Friday, Mr. Biden outlined broad terms that he said were presented by Israel to the American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators who have been pushing for a deal to pause the fighting and free hostages in Gaza. Israeli officials confirmed that the terms matched a cease-fire proposal that had been approved by Israel’s war cabinet but not yet presented to the Israeli public. Now, analysts say, it is crunchtime for Bibi, as the prime minister is popularly known. Mr. Biden “booted Netanyahu out of the closet of ambiguity and presented Netanyahu’s proposal himself,” Ben Caspit, a biographer and longtime critic of the prime minister, wrote in Sunday’s Maariv, a Hebrew daily. “Then he asked a simple question: Does Bibi support Netanyahu’s proposal? Yes or no. No nonsense and hot air.” The leaders of two far-right parties in the coalition — Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s minister of finance, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister — have pledged to bring Mr. Netanyahu’s government down if the prime minister goes along with the deal outlined by Mr. Biden before Hamas is fully destroyed. Some hard-line members of Mr. Netanyahu’s own Likud party have said they will join them. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

ByErika Solomon Israel’s offensive in the southern city of Rafah has strained medical and humanitarian services to the breaking point, aid workers say, with only one hospital still functioning and several aid operations forced to decamp to other parts of the Gaza Strip. The health care crisis in the city has been compounded by the closure of emergency clinics and other services amid continued clashes and strikes that have killed dozens of civilians. On Sunday, a strike that Israel said was aimed at a Hamas compound set ablaze a camp for the displaced in Rafah, killing 45 people, according to the Gazan health ministry. Another strike on Tuesday in Al-Mawasi, on the outskirts of Rafah, killed 21 people and injured dozens, the ministry said. Among the aid operations that have shuttered this week are a field hospital run by the Palestinian Red Crescent, a clinic supported by Doctors Without Borders and kitchens run byWorld Central Kitchen. “As Israeli attacks intensify on Rafah, the unpredictable trickle of aid into Gaza has created a mirage of improved access, while the humanitarian response is in reality on the verge of collapse,” 19 aid groups said in ajoint statementon Tuesday. Some of the operations that were forced to move were in Al-Mawasi, where many civilians and aid workers went because Israel designated part of the area as a humanitarian safe zone. Israel’s military said after the strike on Tuesday that it had not fired on that zone. Videos verified by The New York Times indicate that the strike hit near, but not inside, the zone.

Israeli officials have said seizing the narrow, roughly nine-mile-long area holds crucial importance for preventing Hamas from rearming itself through cross-border smuggling. “It must be in our hands; it must be closed,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel told reporters in December, after being asked whether Israel still intended to capture the zone. An Israeli military official, who briefed reporters Wednesday on condition of anonymity to comply with military protocol, said that troops had identified at least 20 tunnels running from Gaza into Egypt, some of them only recently discovered. But in briefing reporters later on Wednesday night, Admiral Hagari stopped short of claiming that the tunnels crossed the border. “I can’t say now that all of these tunnels cross into Egypt,” he said. “We’ll inspect that, pass along the intelligence” to Egypt. The tunnel shafts in Gaza “are located in proximity to the border with Egypt, including in buildings and homes,” he added. “We’ll investigate and take care of each of those shafts.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

‘All Eyes on Rafah’ Surges on Social Media After a Deadly Israeli Strike,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/middleeast/all-eyes-on-rafah.html,2024-05-29T12:15:21+0000,"The slogan, which has been a touchstone for pro-Palestinian demonstrators for months, ricocheted across social media this week.",The slogan “All Eyes on Rafah” has ricocheted across social media this week following an Israeli strike in the Gazan city that killed dozens of civilians and provoked international outrage.,"Israel-HamasWar Advertisement The slogan, which has been a touchstone for pro-Palestinian demonstrators for months, ricocheted across social media this week. ByAli Watkins The slogan “All Eyes on Rafah” has ricocheted across social media this week following an Israeli strike in the Gazan city that killed dozens of civilians and provoked international outrage. For months, the phrase has been a touchstone in the social and cultural dialogue around Israel’s war against Hamas in the region. It has periodically trended on social media, particularly as Israeli military attacks in the city — located in the southern Gaza Strip, along the Egyptian border — have escalated. On Wednesday, the saying was once again trending, this time through what appears to bean A.I.-generated image showing a field of refugee tentsspelling out “All Eyes on Rafah.” One version of the graphic has been shared more than 38 million times on Instagram. The phrase may have originated in comments made in February by Rik Peeperkorn, who heads the World Health Organization’s office for Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Mr. Peeperkorn was speaking at a news conference as the Israeli military intensified its campaign in the southern Gaza strip. “All eyes are on Rafah,” Mr. Peeperkornsaid at the time. The comment was almost immediately repurposed by pro-Palestinian and humanitarian groups to draw attention to Gaza and Rafah, which was one of the last remaining destinations for displaced Palestinians from other parts of the territory. Among them were Save the Children International, Oxfam and, later, pro-Palestinian lobbying groups like Jewish Voice for Peace. The saying was also heard at pro-Palestinianproteststhat swept across Western universities earlier this month. The deadlystrikein Rafah on Sunday was quicklydenouncedby world leaders. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said the attack had killed two Hamas officials, and he called the civilian deaths a “tragic accident.” Ali Watkinsis a reporter on the Metro desk, covering crime and law enforcement in New York.

But some analysts said the prime minister was aiming at domestic supporters, not the White House. ByAaron Boxerman A day after President Biden called on Israel and Hamas to reach a truce, declaring that it was “time for this war to end,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday reiterated that Israel would not agree to a permanent cease-fire in Gaza as long as Hamas still retains governing and military power. In his statement, Mr. Netanyahu did not explicitly endorse or reject a proposed cease-fire plan that Mr. Biden had laid out in an unusually detailed address on Friday. Two Israeli officials confirmed that Mr. Biden’s proposal matched an Israeli cease-fire proposal that had been greenlit by Israel’s war cabinet. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. But the timing of Mr. Netanyahu’s remarks, coming first thing the next morning, seemed to put the brakes on Mr. Biden’s hopes for a speedy resolution to the war, which has claimed the lives of more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. “Israel’s conditions for ending the war have not changed: the destruction of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu’s office said in the statement released on Saturday morning. Biden administration officials and some Israeli analysts said they believed that Israel still supported the proposal Mr. Biden described on Friday, and that Mr. Netanyahu’s statement on Saturday was more tailored to his domestic audience and meant to manage his far-right cabinet members, rather than to push back against the White House. Mr. Biden is eager for the war to end, with the American presidential election just five months away. But Mr. Netanyahu’s domestic political worries could prove paramount. On Saturday night, two of Mr. Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners — Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir — threatened to quit his government should he move forward with the proposal. Mr. Ben-Gvir labeled the terms of the agreement a “total defeat” and a “victory for terrorism.” If both of their parties left his coalition, it could mark the end of Mr. Netanyahu’s government.

"What Is the Philadelphi Corridor, and Why Does It Matter?",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/world/middleeast/what-is-the-philadelphi-corridor.html,2024-05-30T18:35:10+0000,An eight-mile-long strip of land between the Gaza Strip and Egypt is the latest focus of the Israeli assault on Hamas.,"Israel’s announcement on Wednesday that its forces had gained control over a strip of land that runs along the Gaza Strip's southern border suggested that it had fulfilled one of the goals of the country’s war against Hamas, but it portends further isolation for Palestinians in the enclave.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement An eight-mile-long strip of land between the Gaza Strip and Egypt is the latest focus of the Israeli assault on Hamas. ByMatthew Mpoke Bigg Israel’s announcement on Wednesday that its forces had gained control over a strip of land that runs along the Gaza Strip's southern border suggested that it had fulfilled one of the goals of the country’s war against Hamas, but it portends further isolation for Palestinians in the enclave. Here’s a look at the importance of the border strip to Israel, to Palestinians and to Egypt: It is land around 100 yards wide that runs roughly eight miles from Israel’s border to the Mediterranean. The new border, which divided the city of Rafah, was set up under the Egypt-Israel peace treaty of 1979. To the northeast is Gaza, while Egypt lies to the southwest. Egyptian border guards have been policing the land under an agreement with Israel made in 2005 when Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza. The Israelis used the code name Philadelphi for the strip, while Egyptian officials call it Salah Al Din. Senior Israeli officials had set control of the strip, which in Israel is called the Philadelphi Corridor, as a military objective. Hamas had dug tunnels beneath the strip — some wide enough for trucks, according to military experts — and used them to smuggle weapons and personnel into Gazan territory. “This is the way they can get in and out without asking the Israelis,” said Ahron Bregman, a political scientist and expert in Middle East security issues at King’s College in London, who is a former Israeli military officer. Unless the tunnels are blocked, he said in a previous interview, Hamas could rebuild its military capacity after the war. During other regional conflicts, Egypt has opened its borders to refugees, but the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi fears that if Palestinian civilians crossed the border to escape the war they could destabilize the country and become a drag on its economy.

Years later, the prisoner became a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack. ByJo BeckerandAdam Sella Jo Becker reported from Tel Aviv, and Adam Sella from Nir Oz, Israel. Since the early days of the Israel-Hamas war, they have traced the aftereffects of a fateful encounter between Yahya Sinwar and Dr. Yuval Bitton. This is how Dr. Yuval Bitton remembers the morning of Oct. 7. Being jolted awake just after sunrise by the insistent ringing of his phone. The frantic voice of his daughter, who was traveling abroad, asking, “Dad, what’s happened in Israel? Turn on the TV.” News anchors were still piecing together the reports: Palestinian gunmen penetrating Israel’s vaunted defenses, infiltrating more than 20 towns and military bases, killing approximately 1,200 people and dragging more than 240 men, women and children into Gaza as hostages. Even in that first moment, Dr. Bitton says, he knew with certainty who had masterminded the attack: Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza and Inmate No. 7333335 in the Israeli prison system from 1989 until his release in a prisoner swap in 2011. But that was not all. Dr. Bitton had a history with Yahya Sinwar. As he watched the images of terror and death flicker across his screen, he was tormented by a decision he had made nearly two decades before — how, working in a prison infirmary, he had come to the aid of a mysteriously and desperately ill Mr. Sinwar, and how afterward the Hamas leader had told him that “he owed me his life.” The two men had then formed a relationship of sorts, sworn enemies who nevertheless showed a wary mutual respect. As a dentist and later as a senior intelligence officer for the Israeli prison service, Dr. Bitton had spent hundreds of hours talking with and analyzing Mr. Sinwar, who in the seven months since Oct. 7 has eluded Israel’s forces even as their assault on Gaza has killed tens of thousands and turned much of the enclave to rubble. Now American officials believeMr. Sinwar is calling the shotsfor Hamas in negotiations over a deal for a cease-fire and the release of some of the hostages.

Prayers at Safed Old Jewish Cemetery this month.Credit... Supported by ByDamien Cave Photographs byAmit Elkayam Reporting from Safed, an epicenter of Jewish mysticism. Eyal Ben-Ari tugged at the heavy assault rifle hanging over his shoulder as he tiptoed out of his pink house at sunrise, hoping not to wake his wife or six children. Walking to synagogue in Safed, a hill town above the Sea of Galilee known for centuries as a center of kabbalah, or ancient Jewish mysticism, he said he still didn’t feel great about the gun. Sleeping with the rifle under his pillow, he worried about it being stolen. After his 13-year-old son came home with a toy replica, Mr. Ben-Ari considered returning the real thing, doubting his decision to join the newly formed civilian militia that had given him the weapon. “I feel like it’s very — artificial,” he said, struggling to find the right word in English, looking down at the gun. “It’s not human. It’s not life.” At the synagogue, men with graying beards and black suits — all fellow members of the Chabad movement, an ultra-Orthodox sect of Judaism — slapped Mr. Ben-Ari on the back. They were happy to see him. Happy to see his gun. It was the only one there, but far from unique. In this small city near the Lebanon border, where Hezbollah’s rockets have often rained down in recent months, Israel’s deep sense of vulnerability has led to a surge of citizens arming themselves.

BySteven Erlanger,Isabel KershnerandNatan Odenheimer Reporting from Jerusalem Despite an international court order to stop its assault on Rafah, Israel says it will continue its operation, trying to walk a line between not angering its American allies too much while trying to achieve strategic aims that it considers too important to abandon. For now, after many weeks of admonitions from the White House, both the Israelis and the Americans are characterizing this as a “limited operation,” allowing the Israelis to proceed, though more slowly and cautiously than they had in other parts of Gaza. But as the fighting pushes masses of panicked civilians toward areas near the sea with inadequate housing or medical aid, and the closing of the Rafah border crossing dims hope for speedy delivery of humanitarian aid, Israel’s critics abroad condemn the toll on civilians and are unconvinced by what the Israelis have called restraint. On Friday, the International Court of Justiceordered Israel to immediately halt its offensive in Rafah, saying it endangered the civilian population there, but did not call for a complete cease-fire. Israel says it will not halt its military operation. For Israel, taking Rafah and the border would effectively complete the reconquest of Gaza and could mean a move to a different phase of lower-intensity raids. Rafah has in and under it the last four relatively organized Hamas battalions, a major tunnel infrastructure and rocket launchers, the Israelis say. More important, Israel wants to try to seal the border with Egypt to reduce the smuggling of weapons for the future. “The airstrikes are continuous and intense, and the smell of smoke doesn’t leave the air,” said Mohammad al-Masri, 31, an accountant who has been sheltering in a tent in Rafah for months. “At night, they advance a few meters at a time, and the people flee immediately.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMatthew Mpoke BiggandAaron Boxerman Israel’s military battled deeper into Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on Thursday, expanding its offensive into the city and driving more people out of it, while Israel faced growing international pressure and isolation over its war against Hamas. As the fighting raged, the International Court of Justice in The Hague said it wouldrespond on Fridayto a South African petition to order animmediate haltto the ground assault in Rafah. The court, an arm of the United Nations, has no means of enforcing its orders, but a demand to rein in the invasion would add to the string of diplomatic and legal setbacks for Israel since the war began. This week, the chief prosecutor for another world tribunal, the International Criminal Court,requested arrest warrantsfor Israel’s prime minister and defense minister, along with three Hamas leaders, on charges of crimes against humanity, and three European countries announced over vehement Israeli opposition that they wouldrecognize a Palestinian state. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders are lookingfirst and foremost to domestic public opinion, with much of the country still viewing the war with Hamas as an existential conflict. Even while international support for Israel has eroded over its devastating military response in Gaza, Israelis have remained focused on the brutality of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks. The Israeli military said Thursday that it was operating in the Brazil and Shaboura areas of Rafah — about halfway between the border with Israel to the southeast and the Mediterranean coast to the northwest — to carry out what it called a limited operation against Hamas battalions in the city. The offensive into Rafah, which once held more than a million Palestinians forced out of other parts of Gaza, could be a crucial test of Israel’s relations with the United States, its most important ally and one of the most steadfast.

ByGaya Gupta,Aaron BoxermanandYonette Joseph The International Court of Justice on Friday ordered Israel to “immediately” halt its military offensive in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, dealing another blow to the country as it faces increasinginternational isolationand a drumbeat of criticism over its conduct in the war. The court has few effective means of enforcing its order, and it stopped short of ordering a cease-fire in Gaza, with some of the court’s judges arguing that Israel could still conduct some military operations in Rafah under the terms of their decision. But the order added more pressure on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has faced domestic and external calls to reach a cease-fire deal with Hamas that would lead to the release of hostages held in Gaza. “The court considers that, in conformity with obligations under the Genocide Convention, Israel must immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part,” the court’s president, Nawaf Salam, said in readingthe 13-2 ruling. The court, based at The Hague, also specified the need for open land crossings, in particular the Rafah crossing, as part of its request for “the unhindered provision” of humanitarian assistance and services. Israel has controlled the Rafah crossing for more than two weeks, and very few aid trucks have entered the enclave since, according to United Nations data. The Israeli government said in a statement that its military “has not and will not” take actions that would lead to the partial or complete destruction of the Palestinian population of Rafah. In effect, it said that the court’s decision has no bearing on Israel’s offensive because the prohibited acts are not occurring. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

What the I.C.J. Ruling Actually Means for Israel’s Offensive in Rafah,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/world/europe/icj-israel-rafah-offensive-explained.html,2024-05-30T04:01:02+0000,There is a substantial consensus among legal experts that Israel cannot continue its current Rafah offensive without violating the court’s order.,"I had two thoughts on Friday as I listened to the chief judge of the International Court of Justice tell Israel to halt its military offensive in Rafah, the city in southern Gaza to which more than a million displaced people fled earlier in the conflict.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by The Interpreter There is a substantial consensus among legal experts that Israel cannot continue its current Rafah offensive without violating the court’s order. ByAmanda Taub Reporting from London I had two thoughts on Friday as I listened to the chief judge of the International Court of Justice tell Israel to halt its military offensive in Rafah, the city in southern Gaza to which more than a million displaced people fled earlier in the conflict. The first was thatthe court’s rulingwas unusually forceful: the judge said Israel “must halt” its military offensive in Rafah “immediately.” Many observers had not expected the court to issue such a direct order because it has no jurisdiction to impose similar requirements on Hamas, Israel’s opponent in the war. My second thought was that the court’s use of punctuation was definitely going to provoke debate. Here’s the key part of the ruling: The State of Israel shall, in conformity with its obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and in view of the worsening conditions of life faced by civilians in the Rafah Governorate: Immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. Sure enough, for several days some legal scholars have been arguing about whether the clause that begins “which may inflict” put conditions on the order to “immediately halt.” Has Israel been told to halt its offensive, or to do so only if that offensive is about to partly or completely destroy Palestinians as a group? In some ways, the debate is a distraction. There is a substantial consensus among legal experts that Israel cannot continue its current offensive in Rafah without violating the court’s order. Five leading legal scholars I contacted said the order was clear on that point, and more saidthe sameininterviewsandsocial mediapostsonline. (“The current offensive as currently planned and executed is prohibited under any reading,”wroteAdil Haque, an international law expert at Rutgers University. “This sentence means Israel must halt its current military offensive in Rafah,”wroteJanina Dill, the co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law, and Armed Conflict.)

ByPatrick Kingsley reporting from Jerusalem In 2011, a former Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak,warnedthat Israel faced a “diplomatic-political tsunami” of censure if its conflict with the Palestinians went unresolved, as peace talks faltered and revolution spread across the Middle East. To Israeli foreign policy analysts, that tsunami has never seemed closer. On Friday, the International Court of Justice, an arm of the United Nations,ordered Israel to suspend its military campaign in Rafahin southern Gaza, adding to a growing list of diplomatic and legal moves against Israel that have undermined its international standing. The ruling came just days after prosecutors at the International Criminal Court, another international tribunal, called for thearrest of Israel’s prime ministerand defense minister, a move that was supported by some longstanding partners of Israel, including France. The order came the same week thatthree European countriestook the coordinated step of recognizing Palestine as a state. It also followed widespread university campus protests in the United States against Israel’s campaign in Gaza, as well as decisions byTurkey to suspend trade with Israeland by Belize, Bolivia andColombiato break diplomatic ties with Israel. “This is not North Korea or Belarus or Myanmar levels of isolation — but it is isolation,” said Alon Pinkas, Israel’s former consul general in New York. “It creates a tremendous sense of pressure.” The latest move by the International Court of Justice may not have immediate practical effects: Under the terms of the order, Israel has a month to show how it has complied with its instructions. Even if Israel ignores the order, the I.C.J. has no means of enforcing it. In theory, the United Nations Security Council can issue a resolution on the matter, but the United States, Israel’s most powerful ally, has a permanent seat on the council, enabling it to veto any measure against Israel.

ByGaya Gupta The International Court of Justice on Friday ruled that Israel must immediately halt its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, dealing another blow to the country as it faces increasing international isolation. The court has no means of enforcing its orders, and Israel said the language of the ruling left some room for interpretation. Hard-line politicians in Israel immediately vowed that Israel would not comply. Still, the 13-2 ruling puts more pressure on the Netanyahu government over the conduct of the war. Gazan authorities say at least 35,000 people have been killed, without distinguishing between combatants and civilians, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee repeatedly to avoid the Israeli bombardment, which has devastated most of the enclave. “The court considers that in conformity with obligations under the Genocide Convention, Israel must immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part,” the court’s president, Nawaf Salam, said in reading the ruling.

The ruling is the latest in a series of rebukes of Israel over the conduct of its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

ByNadav Gavrielov When Hamas releasedvideo last month of Keith Siegel, an American-Israeli hostage held in Gaza, it was the first sign in months that he was still alive. His wife, Aviva Siegel, couldn’t bring herself to watch it. “It would be too difficult for me to see the sadness in Keith’s eyes,” Ms. Siegel said in an interview in New York last week, where she was meeting with António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations. Ms. Siegel, 63, was held captive with her husband until late November, when she was one of 105hostages releasedas part of a cease-fire deal. They were taken from their home at Kibbutz Kfar Azza on Oct. 7 during the Hamas-led attacks on Israel. Nearly eight months into the war, the families of hostages have grown increasingly alarmed. Mr. Siegel, who is 65, has a medical condition, and Israeli soldiers have recentlyrecovered the remainsof several hostages in Gaza. For months, Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been trying to get Israel and Hamas toaccept a dealfor another cease-fire and exchange of captives. Ms. Siegel understands the hostages’ experience like few others. “Knowing what they’re going through,” she said, “is too much for me to handle.” She said that she and her husband of over four decades were moved more than a dozen times and were kept in apartments and tunnels, which felt particularly stifling. Ms. Siegel said that they were denied food and water, while their captors ate, and that she lost over 20 pounds. She said her captors would hit and push her, blindfold her and pull her by the hair. They shaved Mr. Siegel’s body to humiliate him, she said. The hostages were not allowed to talk. The captors would play mind games with them, telling them that Israel had ceased to exist, Ms. Siegel said. Ms. Siegel expressed empathy for Gazans and said she wished Israelis and Palestinians could eventually live alongside each other in peace.She has been alarmed by what she said was a global lack of focus on the hostages. “Something really bad happened, and we need the world’s help,” she said. Ms. Siegel often remembers her last conversation with Keith. When the time came for her release from Gaza, she initially refused to leave without him, she said, but soon realized she had to. “I asked Keith to be strong for me, and I said, ‘I’ll be strong for you’ — and that’s what’s keeping me alive,” she said.

ByPatrick Kingsley Reporting from Jerusalem The Israeli military was pressing ahead with its operation in Rafah on Saturday, according to three Israeli officials, a day after the world’s top court appeared toorder Israel to “immediately” cease its military campaignin the southern Gaza city amid a growing international outcry over the offensive. The officials did not say exactly where in the city its forces were striking and fighting. One official said the military continued to advance slowly, but cautioned that it was too early to conclude how Israel would ultimately respond to the court order because it takes time for a military ground operation to change course. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Palestinian news media reported that an Israeli strike had killed one person in central Rafah and that there was also fighting in the eastern suburbs of the city. Strikes were also reported in other parts of the territory, and the Israeli military confirmed that it also continued to operate in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. The International Court of Justice ordered Israel on Friday to suspend its military offensive and “any other action” in Rafah that might wholly or partly destroy the Palestinian population there. Some of the court’s judges said that Israel could still conduct some military operations in Rafah under the terms of their decision. The court has few effective means of enforcing its order, but the ruling adds to a growing list of moves against Israelthat have undermined its international standing. In the immediate aftermath of the ruling, the Israeli government had suggested that it would continue the fight in Rafah, defying a growing group of international partners that feel Israel has gone too far. It said in a written response that its military “has not and will not” take actions that would lead to the destruction of the Palestinian population in Rafah — in effect saying that the court’s decision has no bearing on Israel’s offensive. Israel’s offensive in Rafah has so far displaced more than 800,000 people, most of whom had already been displaced from other parts of Gaza and have been met with miserable conditions in their new encampments. Israel has meanwhile continued to bombard other areas of the enclave, with fighting particularly intense in Jabaliya, where Israel believes Hamas is trying to regroup. In a news briefing on Friday after the decision, a spokesman for the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said that the U.N. chief “trusts” that Israel would “duly comply” with the court’s order. The spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, later added that countries have “a responsibility to enact and to abide” by the court’s decisions. The court decision came as officials from Israel, the United States and Qatar — a mediator between Israel and Hamas — gathered in Paris to try to revive efforts to establish a cease-fire. Negotiationsfaltered earlier in the month, mainly because Hamas wants a permanent cease-fire whereas Israel wants to continue the war after a brief exchange of captives.

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise, and this is “The Daily.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Earlier this week, the top prosecutor of the International Criminal Court requested arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister and its defense minister. The move shocked Israelis and set up a possible showdown between the world’s top criminal court and Israel, together with its biggest ally, the United States. Today, my colleague, Jerusalem Bureau Chief Patrick Kingsley, explains. [MUSIC PLAYING] It’s Thursday, May 23rd. [MUSIC PLAYING] So, Patrick, earlier this week, there was a pretty surprising announcement by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. It had to do with Israel and Hamas. Tell us what happened. Well, on Monday morning, we were all taken by surprise by an announcement from the chief prosecutor at the ICC, the International Criminal Court, the top criminal court in the world. It tries individuals accused of war crimes. And the chief prosecutor announced that he was requesting arrest warrants for five individuals involved in the war between Israel and Hamas for crimes against humanity. Three of them were from Hamas — Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas within Gaza, the Hamas military commander, and the political leader of Hamas, who’s based in Qatar. But maybe the biggest news in this announcement was that the chief prosecutor was seeking the arrest of two of Israel’s top leaders — Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Yoav Gallant, the defense minister. And this was a massive bombshell. These two men are leaders from a major US ally. They’re in regular contact with the US government, and they were being implicitly equated with the three top leaders of an organization, Hamas, that many consider a terrorist organization. And this equation sent shockwaves through Israeli society and, indeed, around the world. So this is absolutely remarkable, Patrick. I mean, I, for one, was quite surprised by seeing this. I want to dig into it with you. So who is this prosecutor behind these requests for these warrants? And how did he reach this decision to go for them in the first place? So the prosecutor’s name is Karim Khan, and he is a British lawyer, a British barrister. He is 54. He’s led a very impressive career. He has spent years working on human rights cases, both defending people and also prosecuting in such cases. He was involved in tribunals related to the wars surrounding the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda. He investigated Islamic State crimes in Iraq. And in 2021, he is appointed the top prosecutor at the ICC. And what are his responsibilities as top prosecutor? Well, it’s his job to travel the world and investigate allegations of human rights abuses, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and in the process, plays a key role in deciding who gets prosecuted at the International Criminal Court. The ICC and the ICC prosecutor investigates and tries people who would not be pursued by the judicial system within their countries of origin. It steps in when it seems like the domestic authorities in any given country are not doing their job. And last year, he famously went after President Putin in Russia in connection with the war in Ukraine. So at what point did this prosecutor, Karim Khan, turn his attention to Israel and Gaza? Well, he actually inherits an investigation from his predecessor that’s looking at Israel’s conduct and also that of Hamas during a previous war in 2014 between the two sides. But then that gets superseded on October 7th by the horrors that we saw that day committed by Hamas and then by the scale and damage caused by Israel’s bombing campaign in its counterattack. And we begin to see not only revulsion and horror at what Hamas had done in early October, but also growing criticism and condemnation of what Israel and its Air Force did in its response. You’ll remember that earlier this year, the International Court of Justice, a separate court also in The Hague, began to address claims that Israel was and is committing a genocide in Gaza, a claim that Israel strongly denies. Right. That was the case that South Africa brought. We did an episode about that. Yes, exactly. So as the world’s attention focuses on this new conflict, so does Karim Khan’s. Also today, the International Criminal Court’s Chief Prosecutor, Karim Khan, QC, has wrapped up a visit to Israel and the occupied West Bank. Khan has visited the region to investigate if war crimes were committed on October 7th. We start to see him arrive in Israel visiting some of the sites that Hamas attacked last year, talking to survivors, talking to leaders, reviewing security camera footage, and so on. I have just come from the border of the Rafah crossing, and we could see Gaza, at least we could see cranes that were on the territory of Gaza. And he also visited the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza, talks to Palestinians. At the Ministry of Justice in Ramallah, the chief prosecutor of the world’s highest court. He goes to the Israeli occupied West Bank, to Ramallah, where the Palestinian Authority is based, building up evidence that led to this announcement on Monday. [MUSIC PLAYING] Today, I’m filing applications for warrants of arrest before Pre-Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Court. And he makes this very dramatic announcement in a video. My office has diligently collected evidence and interviewed survivors and eyewitnesses at the scene of at least six major attack locations. Flanked on each side by two of his deputies. I have reasonable grounds to believe that three senior leaders of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed DEIF and Ismail Haniyeh, bear criminal responsibility for the following international crimes. And the accusations that he makes against the three Hamas leaders focus on the violent actions that Hamas took on October 7th. Extermination as a crime against humanity. Murder as a crime against humanity. And he walked through a long list of charges stemming from the extraordinary violence during that attack. The taking of hostages as a war crime. Rape and other acts of sexual violence during captivity. And he says there are reasonable grounds to believe that hostages taken from Israel have been subject to sexual violence, including rape, while being held in captivity. And he cites assessment of medical records, video, and documentary evidence, as well as interviews with victims and survivors. And I repeat and underline my call for the immediate release of all hostages taken from Israel and for their immediate safe return to their families. So this prosecutor sees the atrocities on October 7th and then what followed with Hamas taking the hostages, abusing them, as crimes against humanity. That’s what it amounted to in his view? Exactly. And what about the charges against the Israelis? These are slightly different. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant bear criminal responsibility for the following international crimes. Obviously, a lot of the outcry and horror at the war in Gaza has centered around Israel’s airstrikes that have killed tens of thousands of Gazans. But Karim Khan focuses not on the military actions of Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, his defense minister, but on the accusation of — Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare. — starvation. The idea that Israel has allegedly sought to restrict and block aid deliveries, food supplies to Gaza with the intent to starve the civilian population there. These individuals, through a common plan, have systematically deprived the civilian population of Gaza of objects indispensable to human survival. And that’s primarily based on the fact that for the first two weeks of the war, until October 21st or so, Israel blocked all aid entry to Gaza after Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, one of these two Israelis whose arrests Mr. Khan seeks, said that he was imposing a total siege on Gaza — no food, no fuel, no electricity. And while that total siege was eased towards the end of October, Khan also notes that there have been continuing restrictions on essential supplies, like food and medicine, ever since. That conduct took place alongside attacks that killed civilians, the obstruction of aid delivery by humanitarian organizations, and attacks on aid workers that forced many of those same humanitarian organizations to either cease operations or limit their life-saving efforts in Gaza. The implication is that the famine that he says is present in some areas of Gaza and imminent in other areas is in part the responsibility of Netanyahu and Gallant. That starvation has caused and continues to cause deaths, malnutrition, dehydration, and profound suffering among the population. My office charges Netanyahu and Gallant as co-perpetrators and as superiors in the commission of these alleged crimes. Why is the focus of these charges starvation? I mean, given that the airstrikes, as you say, were in many ways really the focus of this war and certainly the focus of the world’s attention on this war, the civilian deaths from the military operation. Why starvation? Karim Khan does not explain why he focuses on starvation rather than Israel’s military tactics, which he mentions only in passing. But legal experts have said that it’s easier to prove that starvation was used as a method of warfare than it is to prove that there have been any specific crimes involved in any specific airstrikes. And that’s because under the rules of war and international law, it’s not necessarily illegal in and of itself to kill civilians during wartime. If a military assesses, with the help of military lawyers, that the likely civilian death toll caused by that strike is proportional to the value of the military target, then that, in many cases, will be in accordance with the rules of war. If a military can prove that sense of proportionality, then it’s actually quite hard to prove that there was any crime committed in the process. So in other words, military actions are often weighed quite carefully. In the case of, say, a modern military like Israel’s or the United States, there are lawyers that look at these things. It’s not necessarily so easy to prove that something was disproportionate and should be considered a crime. Exactly. Whereas with the crime of starvation, legal experts say that it’s potentially easier to prove that there was some wrongdoing there because Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Defense Minister, went on record in a public statement, and he announced that there would be a total siege on the territory of Gaza. And that was followed by an action, the action of closing off Gaza’s borders for the next two weeks, and no aid was allowed in. During that time, there were restrictions on electricity, water, fuel, as well as food. And that’s why legal experts think that Karim Khan has gone after Israel with the crime of starvation rather than focusing on their military operations. But I suppose just thinking about our coverage, Patrick, and the conversations you and I have had, famine and starvation and a civilian population in extreme distress trapped in a small piece of territory is also not a small thing, right? That is also something that makes sense that the court would be considering. Absolutely, it’s a huge thing. People don’t have to be hit by an airstrike to be living through an absolutely catastrophic situation. So these charges really seem to spell bad news for Israel and for these two Israeli leaders, Netanyahu and Gallant. And it’s remarkable because these are men who, as you say, are some of America’s closest allies. I mean, they’re, you know, at the Pentagon. They’re having meetings with President Biden. And now, the chief prosecutor of the ICC is saying that they are war criminals. Yes, it is a very dramatic moment in the view of some people, a turning point, and certainly, we can say that it is one of the harshest rebukes of Israel’s wartime conduct since October 7th. [MUSIC PLAYING] But within Israel, there’s been a very different reaction. And it’s not all bad news for Benjamin Netanyahu. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] So, Patrick, what do Israelis make of this announcement? Within Israel, the reaction has been very different. Whether it’s Netanyahu’s allies or his critics, there has been almost uniform outrage that the prosecutor for the ICC would make these accusations. And it means that at a time of rising domestic criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu across the political spectrum, with only a very few exceptions, everyone has rallied behind Netanyahu and Gallant. Despite the fact that Netanyahu is increasingly unpopular and even within his own government, there have been growing criticism of his wartime strategy. For example, just two days before the prosecutor’s announcement, one of the senior members of his own wartime cabinet, Benny Gantz, issued Netanyahu with an ultimatum, warning him that he would quit the government if he did not spell out a plan for a post-war Gaza. Then, suddenly, the announcement comes from Karim Khan that Netanyahu and Gallant are under investigation. And Gantz is one of the first to come out with a condemnation of Karim Khan and a defense of the Israeli government. That is the clearest example of how even critics of Netanyahu have fallen in line, circled the wagons, and presented a united front. This is really interesting. So this action by the prosecutor has kind of had the effect of actually closing divisions that were starting to appear in Israeli society, effectively bringing Netanyahu’s critics kind of back into his camp, or at least making it harder to criticize him. Exactly. And Israelis, in general, feel that Israel has always been targeted unfairly, held to a higher standard than many other countries, and that this is, once again, another example of that, another example of Israel being accused of things that other countries do but get away with. And there have been broadly three criticisms from the Israelis of the ICC prosecutor. First, the Israeli claim is that the ICC prosecutor is making a horrible false equivalence between Hamas, a terrorist organization, and Israel, a democratic state. Hamas raided Israel and launched the bloodiest attack on Jews in a single day since the Holocaust. Israel, in the eyes of Israelis, is fighting a righteous response to protect their citizens and to win back the liberty of the hostages that were captured on October 7th. [MUSIC PLAYING] This guy is out to demonize Israel. He’s doing a hit job. And Netanyahu himself articulated some of the clearest versions of this argument when he went on American television. He’s creating false symmetry, false facts, and he’s doing a grave injustice to the International Court. And he called Khan’s decision absurd, an effort to demonize Israel and to hold it to far higher standards than any other country. He said it would have been as if after 9/11 — That’s like saying after 9/11, well, I’m issuing arrest warrants for George Bush, but also for bin Laden. — arrest warrants had been issued for both Osama bin Laden and George Bush. Or after, in World War II, well, I’m issuing arrest warrants for FDR, but also for Hitler. It’s a hit job. It’s not serious. He’s out to defame Israel, and he’s also pouring gasoline — [MUSIC PLAYING] The second criticism from Israelis has been about process. The ICC was created about two decades ago by a treaty. More than 120 countries have signed that treaty, but Israel has not. And Israel contends that the prosecutor doesn’t have the authority, therefore, to go after Israeli political leaders. Israelis also say that Khan didn’t spend enough time assessing whether Israel was itself investigating these allegations within its own judicial system. Remember that the ICC is a court of last resort. It’s only supposed to intervene when a domestic judicial system is genuinely not making any effort to investigate the alleged crime. And Israelis are saying that Khan didn’t spend enough time investigating Gallant and Netanyahu. The ICC prosecutors have spent 10 years investigating alleged crimes committed during a previous war between Israel and Hamas, but this decision has been issued within just a few months. And Israelis are saying that Khan jumped the gun in that sense. So the Israelis are saying, look, we’re trying to get to it, but you just didn’t give us enough time. Exactly. And they’ve even said that Khan’s team was supposed to be coming this very week to continue that conversation and assess whether Israel was genuinely looking into these allegations by itself. And that they misled Israel by pretending that they would be making that assessment when, in fact, all along they were planning to request arrest warrants. Interesting. So for Israeli officials, they’re seeing it as a kind of activist thing, as opposed to a neutral judicial decision. That’s their claim, at least. The prosecutor’s office says that they have tried to sincerely engage with Israel on this issue, but that it’s become clear to them that Israel does not seriously investigate this kind of crime. So you said, there are three elements to this. What’s the last? The third and last element is on the content of the claim itself. Israel flatly denies that it is responsible for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. It even denies that there is a famine or that the situation is on the point of a famine. It points out all the ways in which it has worked to get much more aid into Gaza since October, including opening more crossings, allowing the US to create a pier on the shoreline of Gaza. It’s allowed some countries to airdrop aid. And certainly, the amount of aid that has gone in recent months has dwarfed the amount that was going in October and November. And while it accepts that its soldiers have obstructed and, at times, even killed aid workers, it says that that obscures the fact that it coordinates every day in detail with aid groups to facilitate thousands of aid missions every month. Isn’t Israel’s argument that these shipments could also include things that could be very useful for Hamas, the group that just killed 1,200 of its citizens? Exactly. No one’s disputing, least of all Israel, that Israeli officials are examining all the aid going into Gaza. The dispute is about whether that’s necessary. Israel says it is. It says that if it didn’t check, then some of these aid convoys might be smuggling in weapons or material that could be used to fight Israel, to kill Israeli civilians. And that, therefore, Israel has no choice but to examine some of these goods going in. Again, the counterargument is that Israel’s checks are far more stringent than they need to be and end up preventing the entry of everyday items that pose no military threat. OK, so that’s the Israeli perspective. How does the United States see the prosecutor’s request here? I mean, the US, obviously, Israel’s biggest ally. Well, the American president, President Biden, condemned it in no uncertain terms. He said the prosecutor’s decision was outrageous. And he condemned him for drawing an implicit equivalence between Hamas and the leaders of the state of Israel. And why did Biden come out so strongly against the prosecutor? We know that humanitarian aid has been a major concern for this administration. So why would Biden be so opposed to something that really is calling out Israel for this aid? First of all, because Israel is a major ally of the United States, and the United States wants to show support for its ally. Second of all, they fear that this kind of criticism, this kind of intervention, will actually make Israel less, rather than more, likely to bring the war to a halt, because the feeling is that it will make Israel more defensive and in turn batten down the hatches. The third reason is that the United States, historically, has never been a particular fan of the International Criminal Court. We mentioned earlier that Israel did not sign the treaty that created the ICC. Well, the United States did not do that either. And that’s in part because American leaders fear that having an international global court undermines American sovereignty. They think it’s the role of the American judicial system to investigate American citizens. And there is a fear that with the United States so active militarily in many parts of the world, that membership of the court, involvement in the court could pave the way for American soldiers being tried for acting on behalf of the United States. And that could somehow dent American foreign policy goals across the world. OK, so the United States doesn’t really like this court, you know, has troops in a lot of places, doesn’t want a court swooping in and prosecuting them when something goes wrong. But I guess the question then, in my mind, Patrick, is does what this prosecutor is doing matter? I mean, America is not a signatory. Israel is not a signatory. So why is this important? Well, for the time being, its meaning is more symbolic than anything else. First, Karim Khan has not issued an arrest warrant. He has requested an arrest warrant for these five people. And three judges will now spend weeks and possibly months deciding whether to uphold those requests. That process can be less than a month. In the case of Vladimir Putin, it was just shy of a month. President Bashir of Sudan was issued with a warrant. That process took roughly a year. When and if they do do that, however, there will be practical effects. If an arrest warrant is issued, it means that any country that’s a member of the International Criminal Court, in theory, should arrest any of these individuals if they enter their territory. That includes more than 120 countries all over the world, much of Europe, Latin America, Africa, and so on. Yes, it’s true that the United States and Israel are not signatories, and neither are Turkey or Qatar, two of the countries where Hamas officials spend much of their time when they’re outside Gaza. So there will still be places for officials on either side of these accusations to travel to. But there are lots of other countries, like France, Italy, both places where Benjamin Netanyahu traveled in the past year, where, in theory, they will not be able to set foot. So the negotiations over the war can still continue, but if Netanyahu travels to France or to Italy, he could be arrested, which is pretty wild. Yes, at least that’s the theory. The national authorities in any given country still have to make a choice about whether they want to follow through with it. But would those countries perhaps not arrest him out of deference to the United States? I think the expectation is that if we got into this scenario, then someone like Netanyahu simply just wouldn’t travel to such a country. But the truth is, we just don’t really know. We are entering unchartered waters. So this is really isolating Netanyahu in the world. Should it go forward? Yes, isolating Netanyahu and to some extent Israel itself. And it has not just practical implications for the physical movement of Netanyahu and his defense minister, Gallant, but it also compounds Israel’s relationship with foreign allies. It complicates Israel’s ability to arm itself. More countries may grow more unwilling to sell Israel arms, or at least they’ll face growing pressure because of this decision not to do so. And it also could force the country to become ever more reliant on the United States as it becomes more of a pariah over its actions in Gaza. Which, of course, puts the United States in an even trickier position with an ally who’s been pretty hard to be friends with of late. Right. And in truth, while the practical consequences of this move are still unknown, they do, in general, compound the sense that Israel is facing more and more diplomatic consequences for its actions. More than a decade ago, a former Israeli prime minister warned that Israel would face what he called a diplomatic tsunami if its conflict with the Palestinians went unresolved. [MUSIC PLAYING] And it’s possible that years later we’re starting to finally see what he meant. Israel does still have its supporters, many of them, but we’re also now seeing during this war a level of criticism that goes above and beyond the kind that we’ve grown used to seeing directed at Israel over the years. [MUSIC PLAYING] In addition to the warrant requests we’ve seen this week, we’ve obviously had an extraordinary wave of protests on American campuses and elsewhere in the world. And earlier this year, we had a watershed moment when the International Court of Justice began hearing accusations of genocide against Israel. And this week, several European countries recognized Palestine as a state. Wow. So if the tsunami hasn’t yet arrived, we can at least say that the waves are getting stronger. [MUSIC PLAYING] Patrick, thank you. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] On Wednesday, the leaders of Spain, Norway, and Ireland announced that they would recognize an independent Palestinian state. The move was largely symbolic, but raised the concern that if neighboring countries followed their lead, Europe could become a counterweight to the American position that statehood for Palestinians should come only from a negotiated settlement with Israel. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] Here’s what else you should know today. Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador who dropped her Republican presidential bid in March, said on Wednesday that she would vote for Donald Trump but stopped short of officially endorsing him. Haley was Trump’s longest standing rival in the 2024 primary contest and had carved out an important lane for herself as the voice for voters looking for an alternative to the former president. Her decision on whether to endorse him could play a pivotal role in the race. Haley has built a formidable network of high-dollar donors and a solid base of college-educated voters that Trump needs to win. And the city of Uvalde, Texas, has reached a settlement with most of the families of children who were shot by a gunman at Robb Elementary School in 2022. To avert a lawsuit, the city promised to overhaul the city’s police force, create a permanent memorial to the victims, and pay $2 million.

[MUSIC PLAYING] So, Patrick, earlier this week, there was a pretty surprising announcement by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. It had to do with Israel and Hamas. Tell us what happened. Well, on Monday morning, we were all taken by surprise by an announcement from the chief prosecutor at the ICC, the International Criminal Court, the top criminal court in the world. It tries individuals accused of war crimes. And the chief prosecutor announced that he was requesting arrest warrants for five individuals involved in the war between Israel and Hamas for crimes against humanity. Three of them were from Hamas — Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas within Gaza, the Hamas military commander, and the political leader of Hamas, who’s based in Qatar. But maybe the biggest news in this announcement was that the chief prosecutor was seeking the arrest of two of Israel’s top leaders — Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Yoav Gallant, the defense minister. And this was a massive bombshell. These two men are leaders from a major US ally. They’re in regular contact with the US government, and they were being implicitly equated with the three top leaders of an organization, Hamas, that many consider a terrorist organization. And this equation sent shockwaves through Israeli society and, indeed, around the world. So this is absolutely remarkable, Patrick. I mean, I, for one, was quite surprised by seeing this. I want to dig into it with you. So who is this prosecutor behind these requests for these warrants? And how did he reach this decision to go for them in the first place? So the prosecutor’s name is Karim Khan, and he is a British lawyer, a British barrister. He is 54. He’s led a very impressive career. He has spent years working on human rights cases, both defending people and also prosecuting in such cases. He was involved in tribunals related to the wars surrounding the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda. He investigated Islamic State crimes in Iraq. And in 2021, he is appointed the top prosecutor at the ICC. And what are his responsibilities as top prosecutor? Well, it’s his job to travel the world and investigate allegations of human rights abuses, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and in the process, plays a key role in deciding who gets prosecuted at the International Criminal Court. The ICC and the ICC prosecutor investigates and tries people who would not be pursued by the judicial system within their countries of origin. It steps in when it seems like the domestic authorities in any given country are not doing their job. And last year, he famously went after President Putin in Russia in connection with the war in Ukraine. So at what point did this prosecutor, Karim Khan, turn his attention to Israel and Gaza? Well, he actually inherits an investigation from his predecessor that’s looking at Israel’s conduct and also that of Hamas during a previous war in 2014 between the two sides. But then that gets superseded on October 7th by the horrors that we saw that day committed by Hamas and then by the scale and damage caused by Israel’s bombing campaign in its counterattack. And we begin to see not only revulsion and horror at what Hamas had done in early October, but also growing criticism and condemnation of what Israel and its Air Force did in its response. You’ll remember that earlier this year, the International Court of Justice, a separate court also in The Hague, began to address claims that Israel was and is committing a genocide in Gaza, a claim that Israel strongly denies. Right. That was the case that South Africa brought. We did an episode about that. Yes, exactly. So as the world’s attention focuses on this new conflict, so does Karim Khan’s. Also today, the International Criminal Court’s Chief Prosecutor, Karim Khan, QC, has wrapped up a visit to Israel and the occupied West Bank. Khan has visited the region to investigate if war crimes were committed on October 7th. We start to see him arrive in Israel visiting some of the sites that Hamas attacked last year, talking to survivors, talking to leaders, reviewing security camera footage, and so on. I have just come from the border of the Rafah crossing, and we could see Gaza, at least we could see cranes that were on the territory of Gaza. And he also visited the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza, talks to Palestinians. At the Ministry of Justice in Ramallah, the chief prosecutor of the world’s highest court. He goes to the Israeli occupied West Bank, to Ramallah, where the Palestinian Authority is based, building up evidence that led to this announcement on Monday. [MUSIC PLAYING] Today, I’m filing applications for warrants of arrest before Pre-Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Court. And he makes this very dramatic announcement in a vid",The New York Times
Israeli Forces Recover Bodies of 3 More Hostages in Northern Gaza,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-bodies-gaza-hamas.html,2024-05-24T10:52:52+0000,"The bodies were found in Jabaliya, where the Israeli military has been trying to root out a renewed Hamas insurgency.","Israeli forces retrieved the bodies of three Oct. 7 Hamas attack victims in an overnight operation in northern Gaza, the Israeli military said on Friday, further heightening fears for the fate of the remaining hostages held in Gaza.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement The bodies were found in Jabaliya, where the Israeli military has been trying to root out a renewed Hamas insurgency. ByAaron BoxermanandJohnatan Reiss Israeli forces retrieved the bodies of three Oct. 7 Hamas attack victims in an overnight operation in northern Gaza, the Israeli military said on Friday, further heightening fears for the fate of the remaining hostages held in Gaza. Israeli officials identified the three hostages as Hanan Yablonka, 42; Michel Nisenbaum, 59; and Orion Hernandez Radoux, a dual citizen of France and Mexico. According to Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, all three were killed in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack, and Hamas militants brought their bodies back to Gaza. Roughly 125 living and dead hostages now remain in Gaza, according to the Israeli authorities, as talks for a cease-fire that would also secure their release have stalled. Israel and Hamas have conducted indirect negotiations for months in an attempt to clinch an agreement, but those talks collapsed in early May. On Thursday, the Israeli prime minister’s office said the war cabinet had ordered its negotiating team tocontinue talks to reach a deal, but prospects appeared remote as Israel pursues its operation in Rafah, in southern Gaza. The Israeli government has faced rising criticism by some of the hostages’ family members, who say it has not gone far enough to reach an agreement. “The recovery of their bodies is a silent but resolute reminder that the state of Israel is obligated to immediately dispatch negotiation teams with a clear demand to bring about a deal that will swiftly return all the hostages home,” said the Hostages Families Forum, a group that represents family members of the captives. Over the past week, a total of seven bodieshave been brought back to Israelfor burial after being retrieved by Israeli soldiers and intelligence officers. They included Shani Louk, Mr. Radoux’s partner, an Israeli-German dual citizen who became a symbol of the brutality of the Hamas attack. Most of the seven hostages brought back had not been publicly declared presumed dead by the Israeli authorities. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByPatrick KingsleyandEdward Wong Reporting from Jerusalem and Washington Diplomats are aiming to restart negotiations for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas at some point in the next week, according to three officials briefed on the process, rekindling hopes of an end to the fighting in Gaza even as Israel presses ahead with its campaign there. According to the officials, preliminary discussions were held this weekend in Paris between David Barnea, the director of Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad; William J. Burns, the director of the C.I.A.; and the Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, one of the lead mediators between Israel and Hamas. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. For months, Qatar, the United States and Egypt have been trying to cajole Israel and Hamas into accepting a truce and an exchange of captives that could help bring the seven-month war to a close. But previous talks have repeatedly broken down over the length and nature of the truce: Hamas wants a permanent cease-fire, allowing it to remain in charge of Gaza, while Israel wants to be able to continue fighting after a pause — so that it can wrest Hamas from power. The other major point of contention in the last round centered on how to transition between different phases of a three-phase deal. Previous sticking points have included the extent to which Israeli troops should withdraw from Gaza during any truce, and whether Israel will allow Gazans to move freely between north and south Gaza. The sides have also disagreed about the number of hostages that should be released by Hamas, as well as the number of Palestinian prisoners that should be freed in exchange by Israel. In the last round, negotiators talked about Hamas possibly releasing 33 hostages, mainly women, the elderly and anyone in need of urgent medical care. More than 120 hostages remain in Gaza, and roughly a quarter of them are dead, according to the latest Israeli assessment. During the talks, Egyptian and Qatari officials have dealt directly with Hamas’s envoys, who do not meet in person with Israeli or American counterparts. Egypt took the lead in the last round of negotiations, which were held in Cairo, though Qatari officials were also present. Diplomats say that the hostage negotiations need to be completed in order to make headway in other related diplomatic initiatives. Those endeavors include a regional debate about who should govern a postwar Gaza; talks over a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia; and negotiations for a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia that is fighting the Israeli military along the Israel-Lebanon border.

ByIsabel Kershner Reporting from Jerusalem With international condemnation mounting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Monday that the killing of dozens of people a day earlier at a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah was “a tragic accident,” but gave no sign of curbing the Israeli offensive in the southern Gaza city. The deadly fire that tore through the encampment on Sunday after an airstrike came at a particularly delicate time for Israel, just days after the International Court of Justice appeared to order the country’s military to halt its offensive in Rafah and as diplomats were aiming to restart negotiations for a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. The Israel military said that the target of the strike in Rafah on Sunday was a Hamas compound, and that “precise munitions” had been used to target a commander and another senior militant official there. But at least 45 people, including children, were killed by the blast and by the fires it set off, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry said that 249 people were wounded. In a speech to the Israeli Parliament on Monday, Mr. Netanyahu said the military had sought to protect noncombatants, by issuing evacuation orders, adding that about a million civilians had left Rafah ahead of, or during, the offensive. “Despite our supreme effort not to harm uninvolved civilians,” he said, “a tragic accident occurred to our regret last night.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByRaja Abdulrahim Israeli forces massed at the entrance to a major hospital in the northern Gaza Strip on Friday, trapping more than a dozen medical personnel inside and all but putting one of the last functioning hospitals out of operation, according to a doctor and Palestinian news media. For days, the Israeli military has bombarded the area around Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia, near the northernmost edge of the territory. Its advance with tanks toward the northern entrances cut off access to the hospital, according to Dr. Eid Sabbah, the head of nursing at the hospital. “Now it is considered practically, because it is besieged, not operational,” said Dr. Sabbah, who had been at the hospital on Thursday. Many patients were receiving kidney dialysis on Thursday, he said, but they also left before the military cut off access. “The military has reached the entrances,” he said. The blockade of Kamal Adwan came two days after the Israeli military ordered patients and staff atAl Awda HospitalnearJabaliya, another major medical center in northern Gaza, to evacuate on Wednesday and then raided the complex. About 30 people remained there, including medical staff and patients in critical condition who could not be transferred. Israeli forces destroyed doors and damaged equipment, Gazan officials said. The Israeli military has repeatedly besieged and assaulted Gaza’s hospitals, contending that Hamas, the armed group that led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, uses them as shields, with its fighters operating within the hospitals and from tunnels beneath them. Hamas and hospital administrators have denied the claims. The Israeli military has taken journalists on tours of one hospital it raided and provided documents it says prove its claims about Hamas and hospitals.

ByMatina Stevis-Gridneff reporting from Brussels In Europe, long a vital source of support for Israel, the political center of gravity is moving away from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. Spain, Ireland and Norway on Wednesday recognized Palestinian statehood, despite vehement Israeli and American opposition. And most European governments offered unequivocal support to the International Criminal Court this week, after it requested arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister and defense minister, along with leaders of Hamas. Israel still has staunch allies within the European Union, especially Hungary and the Czech Republic, and key players like Germany, despite growing discomfort with Israel’s conduct, have not shown any inclination to alter their stance. The growing fissures within Europe mean that the consensus-driven European Union will not change its positions any time soon. But European countries face rising international and domestic pressure to take a firmer stand against Israel’s handling of the Palestinian territories, and particularly the devastating war in Gaza. Sweden prominently became one of a handful of European Union members to recognize Palestinian statehood a decade ago. Europe has long supported the eventual creation of a Palestinian state — the “two-state solution” that Israel’s government steadfastly opposes — and voiced frustration with Israel’s handling of the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank, but most nations have been unwilling to go further. Instead, the European Union, before the war, was moving closer to Israel, including through financially and politically important partnerships in trade and science.

Friedman Opinion Columnist The decision by Spain, Norway and Ireland on Wednesday to recognize an independent Palestinian state marks the latest brick in the wall of rejection being built around Israel’s current far-right government, which is asking the world to let it destroy Hamas in Gaza while refusing to work on a new future with non-Hamas Palestinians. More than140 countries and the Holy Seehave recognized the right of Palestinians to have a state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. What is noteworthy about this latest move, though, is that major Western European countries, and the United States, had resisted going there, arguing that peace should be worked out between the two parties. Until today. My focus is always on the practical: Will these recognitions of a nonexistent Palestinian state with undefined borders lead to the only sustainable solution — a real-life peace between two states for two indigenous communities — Jews and Palestinians? The answer is yes and no. In the short term, these diplomatic recognitions from fellow democracies will not move the Israeli public, Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, told me. In the wake of the horrific murders, rapes and kidnappings perpetrated by Hamas on Oct. 7, he said, Europeans telling Israel that it must accept a Palestinian state — “without even mentioning that it must be demilitarized or any obligations on the part of Palestinians to reject Hamas” — will be “rejected” by the Israeli silent majority. In the long term, though, it is precisely these kinds of diplomatic shocks that could lead the opposition leaders in Israel to finally escape from the gravitational pull of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who dominates what is or is not permissible to say on this subject — and start calling for two states on terms Israel can live with. One can already see signs of that. If that does not transpire, though, Israel is heading for a world of hurt. Those recognitions of a Palestinian state by European nations “are a huge straw in the wind, that will grow into a hurricane if Israel does not change course,”Craig Charney, a pollster who was a member of Nelson Mandela’s polling team in the 1990s, told me. Charney explained that the isolation of South Africa’s apartheid regime started with a voluntary arms embargo in the 1960s, which after the Soweto uprising morphed in the 1970s into a formal U.N. arms embargo, which grew into a popular cause on campuses and in boardrooms in the early 1980s, which grew into a broader economic, military and travel embargo in the mid-1980s — until two great leaders, Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk, finally emerged to end apartheid. “But it was a very painful journey,” he said.

ByAdam Rasgon Reporting from Jerusalem Israel’s Communications Ministry confiscated camera equipment from The Associated Press on Tuesday afternoon, claiming the agency had violated a new broadcasting law by providing images of northern Gaza to Al Jazeera. But hours later, Israel’s communications minister, Shlomo Karhi,reversed the decision and ordered the equipment be returned to The A.P. It was not clear when the equipment would be given back to the news agency. The reversal came after the Biden administration expressed major concerns to the Israeli government and demanded the equipment be returned, according to an Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic communications. The seizure appeared to be an escalation in Israel’s efforts to punish Al Jazeera, the Pan-Arab broadcaster that the Israeli government voted toshut down two weeks ago. It raised questions about how far the Israeli authorities would go to cut off the Qatari-funded channel, which has provided extensive coverage of Israel’s military offensive in Gaza. Lauren Easton, The A.P.’s vice president of corporate communications, had denounced the Israeli government’s action, calling it “an abusive use” of a new law that provides the authorities with tools to crack down on foreign news organizations. In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, the Communications Ministry said inspectors had gone to a location in southern Israel used by The A.P. to broadcast live footage of the border with northern Gaza, which is several miles away. The ministry claimed that the feed was illegally being carried by Al Jazeera and asserted that it was showing the activities of Israeli soldiers and threatening their lives.

ByAmanda Taub Reporting from London The decision of Karim Khan, the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor, topublicly seek arrest warrantsfor the leaders of Hamas and Israel this week will be one of the most significant and contentious of his career. Khanaccusedthree Hamas leaders of war crimes and crimes against humanity relating to the Oct. 7 attack on Israel andhostage taking. He also accused Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its defense minister, Yoav Gallant, of war crimes and crimes against humanity during Israel’s military operation in Gaza, including thestarvationof civilians. Now a three-judge panel will consider whether to issue the warrants. Some countries welcomed the news as a sign that all individuals, regardless of their state or status, are equal before the law, while others — including the United States, Israel’s most important ally — denounced the charges and accused Khan of false equivalence in pursuing warrants for Hamas and Israeli leaders at the same time. Khan didn’t have to announce the warrant applications publicly. He could have waited until they were granted, as with the warrant for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last year — a process that can take weeks or months. So why did he go public now and with such fanfare — issuing not only anews release, but also social media videos and aprerecorded interviewwith CNN? The answer lies partly in the extraordinarily polarizing nature of this conflict, in which any legal intervention would be subject to deep scrutiny. It’s also about what the prosecutor’s office hopes to achieve as military action continues in Gaza, famine looms and hostages remain in captivity.

ByJulian E. BarnesandEdward Wong Reporting from Washington William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, who has been the lead American negotiator in efforts for a cease-fire in Gaza, plans to travel to Europe this weekend for talks with his Israeli counterpart to try to revive the stalled discussions over a pause in the fighting and the release of hostages, according to a U.S. official and another person briefed on the negotiations. This month, frustration boiled over between officials from Hamas and Israel, and the countries mediating — the United States, Qatar and Egypt — put the talks on hold. Israeli officials were upset with what they saw as shifting negotiating stances by Hamas, including the number of hostages to be released in a first phase. Hamas was upset by Israel’s operations in Rafah, the southern Gazan city, whichhave been progressingsince. But core to the dispute were disagreements over how to define a cessation of hostilities between Hamas and Israel, and how different stages of the cease-fire would be put into effect. The resumption of talks, at an undisclosed location in Europe, is expected to take place over the next few days. It is not clear if Egyptian and Qatari negotiators will join Mr. Burns and David Barnea, the chief of the Mossad, Israel’s spy agency, to directly take part in the discussions. Mr. Burns, however, has been in close contact with Egyptian and Qatari negotiators as the mediators look to get the talks back on track, said a U.S. official. In early May,Mr. Burns did shuttle diplomacybetween Egypt and Israel trying to push for the first phase of an agreement to begin, including a staggered process for the release of hostages and a temporary halt in fighting. The talks in the coming days are expected to be the first since that round of negotiations ended. While it is unclear what could be achieved with Mr. Burns’s new discussions, restarting the talks is, at this point, a notable development. U.S. officials say a hostage-for-cease-fire agreement has to be reached for all their other diplomatic efforts to get momentum, including discussions of a postwar administration in Gaza and a megadeal for a Palestinian state that the Americans and Saudis want Israel to agree to. But Israeli military operations in Rafah continue to complicate the picture. The more aggressive the Israeli operations there, the less Hamas wants to negotiate. Some American officials have said Israel is taking their advice on how to mitigate some civilian casualties — which has contributed to an erosion of international support for Israel with over 35,000 people dead, according to the Gazan health authorities. On Wednesday, Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said he was optimistic that Israel, so far, was not conducting the kind of major operation in Rafah that the United States had feared it would. But questions remain about exactly what the Israeli intentions for Rafah over the longer term might be. Julian E.

Israel Responds to Move to Recognize Palestinian State by Withholding Funds,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/middleeast/israel-reacts-palestinian-finance.html,2024-05-22T13:06:32+0000,"The finance minister’s office signaled that the decision, which could worsen the Palestinians’ dire economic crisis, was a response to Spain, Norway and Ireland recognizing Palestinian statehood.","Israel will not transfer much-needed funds to the Palestinian Authority in the wake of the decision by three European countries to recognize a Palestinian state, the country’s finance minister said on Wednesday, as its foreign minister denounced the European moves as giving “a gold medal to Hamas terrorists.”","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement The finance minister’s office signaled that the decision, which could worsen the Palestinians’ dire economic crisis, was a response to Spain, Norway and Ireland recognizing Palestinian statehood. ByAaron Boxerman reporting from Jerusalem Israel will not transfer much-needed funds to the Palestinian Authority in the wake of the decision by three European countries to recognize a Palestinian state, the country’s finance minister said on Wednesday, as its foreign minister denounced the European moves as giving “a gold medal to Hamas terrorists.” The decision by the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right leader who opposes Palestinian sovereignty, threatened to push the Palestinian government into a deeper fiscal crisis. He said in a statement that he had informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would no longer send tax revenues to the authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank in close cooperation with Israel. Mr. Smotrich’s office signaled that the decision was at least partly a response to Spain, Norway and Ireland recognizing Palestinian statehood, and that the Palestinian leadership bore responsibility for campaigning for the move. “They are acting against Israel legally, diplomatically and for unilateral recognition,” said Eytan Fuld, a spokesman for Mr. Smotrich, referring to the authority. “When they act against the state of Israel, there must be a response.” The Israeli move drew a rebuke from the White House, but no threat of action in response. “I think it’s wrong on a strategic basis, because withholding funds destabilizes the West Bank. It undermines the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people, which is in Israel’s interests,” Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, said at a news conference. “And I think it’s wrong to withhold funds that provide basic goods and services to innocent people.” Mohammad Mustafa, the recently inauguratedPalestinian Authority prime minister, warned that the dire fiscal situation was contributing to a “very serious moment” in the West Bank, which has faced increasing unrest since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel.

Former Trump Officials Meet in Israel With Netanyahu.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/world/middleeast/trump-officials-israel-netanyahu.html,2024-05-20T22:02:40+0000,"Robert O’Brien, one of Donald Trump’s closest foreign policy advisers, said he was there as a “private citizen.”","One of former President Donald J.

Trump’s closest foreign policy advisers, Robert O’Brien, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Monday as part of a delegation of former Trump officials that visited a number of Israeli leaders. Mr. O’Brien, who served as national security adviser to Mr. Trump and is expected to play a significant role in any second Trump administration, was joined in the meetings by two other former Trump officials — the former ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, John Rakolta, and the former ambassador to Switzerland, Ed McMullen. The members of the delegation were described by Marshall Wittmann, a spokesman for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobbying group whose affiliate, the American Israel Education Foundation, funded and organized the trip. In a brief phone interview, Mr. O’Brien said he had wanted to visit Israel ever since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7 to express his “solidarity for Israel and the Jewish people.” Mr. O’Brien said Mr. Trump was aware of his trip to Israel, but he said the former president had not asked him to go or directed him to say anything to Mr. Netanyahu. He said he was there as a “private citizen,” adding that he did express his view to Mr. Netanyahu that the Hamas terrorist attack would never have happened if Mr. Trump were still president. Asked whether Mr. Netanyahu also expressed these views about Mr. Trump, Mr. O’Brien said: “He’s a pro, and he understands he needs good relations with the Biden administration. But that was my sentiment.” The former Trump administration officials and Mr. Netanyahu met on Monday not long after the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor in The Hague, Karim Khan, sought arrest warrants for Mr. Netanyahu, his defense chief and three Hamas leaders on charges of crimes against humanity.

"As Israel’s Hard Line Stokes Anger Abroad, Netanyahu May Get Benefits at Home",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-gaza-war.html,2024-05-23T17:49:54+0000,"Despite diplomatic blows this week, Israeli leaders are focused on their public, which still largely views the war with Hamas in Gaza as an existential conflict.","Israel took several tough diplomatic blows over the past week, some of which had been feared for years.

ByAaron Boxerman reporting from Jerusalem Israel took several tough diplomatic blows over the past week, some of which had been feared for years. Yet the rising outcry against Israel abroad appears not to have swayed the Israeli public, whose views on the country’s military campaign in Gaza are largely different from those of the rest of the world. Just this week, Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, announced he wasseeking arrest warrantsfor Israel’s prime minister and defense minister on charges of crimes against humanity, alongside three leaders of Hamas; three European countries announced they wouldrecognize a Palestinian state; and Israel backed down on seizing equipment from The Associated Press after an international backlash. But Israeli leaders are lookingfirst and foremost to their public, which, analysts say, still views the war with Hamas in Gaza as an existential conflict. While international support for Israel has eroded over its devastating military response in Gaza — with over 35,000 people dead, according to health authorities there — Israelis have largely remained focused on the brutality of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks and the fate of hostages taken that day. Political analysts say that Mr. Netanyahu hopes to leverage the rising international criticism to tamp down frustration at home over his failure to either decisively defeat Hamas or bring home the remaining hostages in Gaza. Some of Mr. Netanyahu’s key rivals rallied to his defense on Monday after Mr. Khan announced that he would seek a warrant for his arrest. “Israel is not only isolated, but feels that it is under some kind of siege,” said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat. For many Israelis, memories ofthe massacre in southern Israel— in which roughly 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to the Israeli authorities — remain a constant backdrop to the conflict. Months later, Israeli news media still continually airs the stories of victims, survivors and the families of those held hostage in Gaza. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMichael Crowley,Euan WardandThomas Fuller Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Wednesday that he would continue to press urgently for a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip despite a counterproposal from Hamas that he said included unacceptable demands. After more than eight months of war in Gaza, the proposed cease-fire deal follows an outline made public last month by President Biden and has the endorsement of the United Nations Security Council. But Israel and Hamas still appear to be far from reaching a deal. “In the days ahead, we are going to push on an urgent basis,” Mr. Blinken said, “to try and close this deal.” Speaking at a news conference in Doha, Qatar, alongside Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who serves as both Qatar’s prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Blinken said that “a deal was on the table that was virtually identical” to one that Hamas put forward on May 6. But Hamas’s response, he said, which was received by Egyptian and Qatari mediators and passed to American officials on Tuesday, makes demands that “go beyond positions that it had previously taken and accepted.” “Some of the changes are workable, some are not,” Mr. Blinken said. He declined to disclose details about the Hamas counterproposal but suggested that the group’s changing demands called into question its negotiators’ sincerity. At some point, he said, “you have to question whether they’re proceeding in good faith or not.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Neither Israel nor Hamas has publicly accepted the plan, but Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Tuesdayheld talksin the region to press for its adoption. Here’s a look at how the cease-fire would work, and at some of the areas of dispute between the warring parties. The plan would unfold inthree phases. Underphase one, there would be a six-week cease-fire and the release of hostages who are older or wounded, or who are women, as well as the return of the remains of some people who died in Gaza while in captivity. In exchange, Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza, and more humanitarian aid would be distributed in the enclave. Civilians, most of whom have been displaced, would be free to return to their homes, including in northern Gaza, an area devastated by Israeli airstrikes and fighting. As all of this happens, talks over a permanent cease-fire would continue, with the goal of reaching phase two: the full withdrawal of Israel’s military, the return of all hostages and the freeing of more Palestinian prisoners.

"As the War in Gaza Drags on, Palestinians in the West Bank Have ‘Reached Rock Bottom’",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/video/palestinians-west-bank-war.html,2024-06-11T08:55:04+0000,"Since the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, Israel has tightened its grip on the occupied West Bank. Two Palestinians describe how they have been impacted — and their worries for the future.","As the war in Gaza enters its eighth month, Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank continue to face onerous restrictions, economic difficulties and an increased military presence — changes that some worry may become the new normal.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement transcript In the occupied West Bank, Palestinians live in the shadow of the ongoing war in Gaza. For them, this has meant increased raids and arrests, tightening security restrictions, settler violence and economic turmoil. We spent time with two Palestinians whose lives and livelihoods are being reshaped by the war and who worry that some of these changes may be long lasting. 29-year-old taxi driver and tour guide Laith Al-Muti now waits all day here at one of the Israeli-controlled checkpoints into Bethlehem. But these days, barely any visitors come through. Thirteen miles away in the Tel Rumeida area of Hebron, Wijdan Ziadeh’s life is also at a standstill. The site of an Israeli settlement, Palestinians in the area say their movement, limited before the war, has felt even more restricted since Oct. 7. Control over security in Hebron is divided into two zones. H1 is managed by the Palestinian Authority and H2, where Ziadeh lives, is managed by the Israeli military. The Israeli military told The Times that security measures have increased in the West Bank as part of a response to terrorist operatives, including Hamas, and that their forces are in Tel Rumeida to help ensure the safety of all residents. But Ziadeh lives in fear of scenes of settler aggression like this one captured by a nearby Palestinian resident. Ziadeh says since the war, her settler neighbors have become even more aggressive towards her and her two sons. Throughout the West Bank, incidents of settler violence against Palestinians jumped in the aftermath of Oct. 7, according to the U.N., who have recorded nearly 950 attacks as of June 2024. Palestinians in the area say that the Israeli military are there to protect the settlers and that settler violence against Palestinians largely goes unpunished, a decades-long pattern detailed in a recent Times investigation. Back in Bethlehem, Laith also fears for the future. Sites he used to frequent with tourists, like the Church of the Nativity, now sit empty. Al-Muti and Ziadeh say they don’t know what’s next for them or for others in the West Bank. BySarah Kerr As the war in Gaza enters its eighth month, Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank continue to faceonerous restrictions, economic difficulties and an increased military presence— changes that some worry may become the new normal. Throughout the West Bank, daily life — restricted before Oct. 7 — has been further complicated by myriad factors. These include regular raids and arrests by Israeli forces, emboldened settlers and regulations that have hampered the economy, such as the cancellation of permits to work in Israel and an increase in internal checkpoints and roadblocks, complicating movement throughout the territory. The Israeli military said there had been a “significant increase” in terrorist attacks in the West Bank since the beginning of the war and told The New York Times that arrests of suspected “terrorist operatives,” as well as the strategic placement of security forces, were necessary “to improve the safety of all residents of the sector.” We spent time with two Palestinians in the West Bank to learn how they have been affected by these changes. In Bethlehem, a city whose economy islargely dependent on tourism, few are arriving to visit sites like the Church of the Nativity, the supposed birthplace of Jesus. Laith Al-Muti, 29, a local tour guide and taxi driver, spends his days waiting at the main checkpoint from Jerusalem into Bethlehem, hoping to attract local fares. Al-Muti and other drivers said they were making a fraction of what they earned before the war. “I don’t know for how long people will have energy,” said Al-Muti. “I might be making 20 or 40 shekels, (roughly $5-$11) working in my taxi, but some people haven’t earned one shekel in seven months.” Thirteen miles away in the Tel Rumeida area of Hebron, Widjan Ziadeh, 56, a widow, and her sons live in fear. Hebron is divided into two zones: H1, where security is controlled by the Palestinian Authority, and H2, where security is controlled by the Israeli military. Tel Rumeida, located in H2, is surrounded by Israeli-run checkpoints. Since the war, Palestinians in the area said they had been subject to increased restrictions and difficulties. Tel Rumeida, the site of an Israeli settlement, has some who are violent and aggressive, according to Palestinians in the area, and tensions have run high for decades. Ziadeh said her son Faris, 20, had nearly lost all vision in one eye following a settler attack in 2022, but the family never filed a criminal complaint to the Israeli authorities because oflimited expectations of justice. For now, Ziadeh is determined to stay and keep her house from being taken over by settlers. “We won’t leave. This is our land and we’ll stay here,” she said. “We’ll live and die in suffering.” Sarah Kerris a Times senior video journalist covering news and investigations.More about Sarah Kerr Advertisement",The New York Times

ByAnjana Sankar Yemen’s Houthi rebels attacked a merchant ship in the Red Sea on Wednesdayin the latest escalation of the Iran-backed militia’s campaign against shipping in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. A British government maritime agency said the vessel was “hit on the stern by a small craft” about 66 nautical miles southwest of the Houthi-held port of Hodeida in Yemen. After the attack, the ship was “taking on water, and not under command of the crew,” the agency, The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, said in a statement on its website. The statement said the ship’s master had reported it was also “hit for a second time by an unknown airborne projectile.” A Houthi military spokesman, Yahya Saree, said in a televised speech that the group had used unmanned surface boats, a number of drones and ballistic missiles to target the ship, which he identified as the Tutor, a Greek-owned bulk carrier. He claimed the ship was seriously damaged and could sink. On Wednesday, the Houthis said they launched two joint military operations with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, on the Israeli cities Ashdod and Haifa, a claim Israel denied. Since November, the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on ships in the vital sea route in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, stifling global maritime trade. In retaliation, the U.S. and British navies have been intensifying airstrikes against Houthi targets,the latest coming on June 7after the rebel group detained 11 United Nations employees in Yemen. The U.S. Central Command said its forces had destroyed four aerial drones and two anti-ship missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen last Friday, as well as a Houthi patrol boat in the Red Sea. In February, American military officials said the United States struck five Houthi military targets, including an undersea drone they described as an “unmanned underwater vessel” that they believed the Houthis could have received from Iran.

ByIsabel Kershner Reporting from Jerusalem Still fighting Israel’s outside enemies on multiple fronts, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu woke up on Monday to a new political battlefield at home. Thedeparturethis weekend of Benny Gantz and his centrist National Unity party from Israel’s emergency wartime government is unlikely to immediately sever Mr. Netanyahu’s grip on power. The prime minister’s governing coalition still commands a narrow majority of 64 seats in the 120-seat Parliament. But Mr. Gantz’s move means that Mr. Netanyahu is now totally dependent on his far-right and ultra-Orthodox coalition partners as he prosecutes the war in Gaza in the face ofmounting international opprobrium, leaving him increasingly isolated and exposed at home and abroad. Mr. Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, another powerful member of National Unity, also leftMr. Netanyahu’s small war cabinet. They are both former military chiefs who were widely viewed as key voices of moderation in the five-member body, which was formed in October after the Hamas-led assault on Israel prompted the Israeli bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza. The two centrist politicians raised public confidence in the government’s decision-making at a time of national trauma. They also lent the war cabinet an aura of legitimacy and consensus as Israel fought Hamas in Gaza, as well as its archenemy Iran and its other proxies, including the powerful Hezbollah militia across Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. Mr. Gantz accused Mr. Netanyahu of “political procrastination,” suggesting that he had been putting off critical strategic decisions to ensure his political survival. His decision to quit the wartime government ushers in a new period of political instability and has left many Israelis wondering where the country goes from here.

More than 20 of the protesters were arrested on Monday night and were released after being given misdemeanor citations for disrupting the campus. The demonstration began earlier Monday in the form of a funeral procession, winding its way through campus as protesters read the names of Palestinians killed during the Israel-Hamas war. It was the latest indication that protesters intended to remain vocal, ahead of commencement ceremonies later this week and a Wednesday decision from the University of California regents about who U.C.L.A.’s next chancellor will be. The university has experienced a tumultuous spring. Violent attacks by supporters of Israel began on the night of April 30, followed about a day later by the dismantlement of a pro-Palestinian encampment, involving hundreds of arrests. Administrators had allowed that encampment to stand for days, but on Monday, scores of police officers and private security guards moved in swiftly. In one instance, they rushed in to confront protesters who tried to barricade themselves in a courtyard. In another instance, two officers pointed nonlethal weapons toward protesters as another demonstrator was being arrested and taken into a campus building.

Why the Head of One of New York’s Most Elite Schools Quit,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/nyregion/collegiate-school-head-israel-gaza.html,2024-06-10T19:59:10+0000,The leader of Collegiate School in Manhattan stepped down after an internal report found “problems of religious and cultural bias.”,The leader of one of New York’s most elite schools has stepped down after a damning internal audit found “disquieting problems of religious and cultural bias” at the school.,"Advertisement Supported by The leader of Collegiate School in Manhattan stepped down after an internal report found “problems of religious and cultural bias.” ByKatherine Rosman The leader of one of New York’s most elite schools has stepped down after a damning internal audit found “disquieting problems of religious and cultural bias” at the school. David Lourie, who became the leader of the all-boys Collegiate School in Manhattan justfour years ago, announced on Monday that he and the board had agreed he would leave his post as head of school. “After four years filled with shared successes alongside challenges that required difficult and at times divisive decisions, we agreed that a new Head of School is what is best for the boys and the school community,” Mr. Lourie said in an email to the school community. The Collegiate report, issued in May and reviewed by The New York Times, was commissioned by the school to investigate parents’ concerns about antisemitism and Islamophobia. Nearly two weeks later, a gender discrimination lawsuit was filed against Collegiate and Mr. Lourie by one of the school’s deans, who claimed that Mr. Lourie had referred to the report as “a joke” and a “power play by Jewish families.” Mr. Lourie andJonathan Youngwood, the president of the school’s board of trustees, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Collegiate is among numerous private schools across New York City that have experienced intense disagreement over how administrators and faculty members have addressed the Israel-Hamas war. Private-school parents, teachers, administrators and students have been discussing — and in some cases, arguing over — the appropriate ways for schools to address issues related to the war both in the classroom and in broader academic and community discourse.

ByJonathan Weisman The United Automobile Workers has scored a remarkable string of victories — most recently, a landmark contract on Monday for electric vehicle battery workers — as its new leadership strives to restore the union’s image as the voice of an iconic segment of the American working class. But competing for headlines is a part of the union that represents tens of thousands of university workers, which at the moment is singularly focused on a mission far from building cars and trucks: ending Israel’s war in Gaza. U.A.W. leaders insist that they can smooth out the dissonance between the dual thrusts of U.A.W. activism — one on college campuses, the other on red-state assembly lines. But it will not be easy. The U.A.W. signs that are crowding pro-Palestinian encampments on campuses, furnished by the union’s international headquarters in Detroit, have alone struck sour notes among some union members uncomfortable with such outward signs of politics on such a fraught topic. “It’s so bad for the union,” said Isaac Altman, a U.A.W. member and staff lawyer in the family court bureau of the Legal Aid Society of Nassau County, N.Y., who has clashed with his local over a pro-Palestine resolution he called “slightly more radical than Hezbollah.” (The resolution called for an immediate cease-fire and an end to “the occupation and blockade of Palestinian land, sea and air by Israeli military forces.”) The competition for attention may only get worse. On Monday, union negotiators reached a tentative agreement with General Motors that could prove to be a landmark in the auto industry’s transition to electric vehicles. It would give huge wage increases and far more safety protections toemployees at an E.V. battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, solid evidence that President Biden’s efforts to combat climate change could fulfill his promise that a green future will not leave workers behind. “It’s a huge deal,” said Dave Green, the regional director of the U.A.W. in Ohio and Indiana. “We’ve been trying to have a just transition and stop this race to the bottom for wages for E.V. workers. This contract is very exciting.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

There are roughly 120 captives still in the enclave. ByEphrat Livni Israelis briefly breathed a collective sigh of relief on Saturday, when the military announced it had rescued four hostages who were held in Gaza for eight months after being captured in the Oct. 7 attack led by Hamas. The four hostages were taken at the Nova music festival on Oct. 7 and were rescued in an operation in the town of Nuseirat in central Gaza early Saturday. The mission left scores of Palestinians, including women and children, dead. News of the rescue raised renewed questions about the fate of those who remain in captivity and a proposed cease-fire deal. How many hostages are still being held in Gaza? Roughly 120 captives remain in Gaza. The Israeli military has confirmed that at least 30 of them have died. Earlier this month, the Israeli military informed the families of four hostages that they were dead and that their bodies were being held by Hamas. In May, the military recovered the bodies of nine hostages, and the families of two Thai citizens who had been captured were informed that their bodies were still being held in Gaza. Will Israel undertake more rescue operations? Dozens of proposed rescue missions have not gone forward for fear the hostages or soldiers would lose their lives in the process, according to Israeli defense officials. Israeli troops have managed to rescue only seven living hostages in three separate military operations. In December, Israeli troops accidentally fired on and killed three hostages in Gaza who were trying to reach safety. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Protest Against Gaza War Draws Thousands to the White House,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/us/politics/white-house-gaza-protest.html,2024-06-09T00:55:27+0000,"The demonstration included ringing the White House grounds with a red banner showing the names of the more than 36,000 Palestinians killed during the war.",Editor’s note: This article was updated on June 10 with a statement from the National Park Service.,"Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by The demonstration included ringing the White House grounds with a red banner showing the names of the more than 36,000 Palestinians killed during the war. transcript Protesters: “Forty thousand people dead.” “Joe Biden, your hands are red.” [cheering] “We will free Palestine.” “We will free Palestine.” ByMinho Kim Reporting from Washington Editor’s note: This article was updated on June 10 with a statement from the National Park Service. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters in Washington converged around the White House on Saturday, urging President Biden to stop all military aid to Israel and calling for an immediate cease-fire in Israel’s war in Gaza. Holding signs calling Mr. Biden a liar, the protesters, mostly clad in red and bearing Palestinian flags, marched around the block of parkland where the White House sits. They spilled across two six-lane boulevards, pushing out tourists, whose faces showed variations of confusion, anger or intrigue. The police presence was heavy, and the U.S. Park Police used pepper spray against a protester at least once. Mr. Biden was not at the White House but in France, where he joined President Emmanuel Macron for a state dinner in Paris on Saturday night. But the dissenting voices in the American capital highlighted the challenges he faces domestically as he tries to carve out a narrow position that both supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas and calls for a quick cessation of hostilities. The pro-Palestinian activists outside the White House, who were highly critical of the Biden administration’s response to the war, encouraged a key portion of Mr. Biden’s base — young and nonwhite voters — to reconsider their support for the president ahead of the election this fall. “There is no world in which I can confidently vote for” Mr. Biden, said Nas Issa, a spokeswoman for the Palestinian Youth Movement, one of the left-leaning groups that organized Saturday’s protest. If Mr. Biden “doesn’t change course and hold Netanyahu and the Israeli government at large to account, under what circumstances would it be acceptable to any person of conscience to vote for him?” she added, referring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. On Saturday afternoon, some protesters created a ring along the mile-long White House perimeter, unspooling consecutive lengths of red paper on which names of the more than 36,000 Palestinians who had been killed during the war were written. The others marched along the perimeter. The format was intended to evoke a red line that, if crossed by the Israeli military in Gaza, would cause Mr. Biden towithhold weapons shipments to Israel.

Since the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, Israel has freed only a small number of hostages through military force. Saturday’s rescues occurred in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, where health officials reported that dozens of Palestinians had been killed. Here is what we know about the four hostages who were brought back to Israel. Noa Argamani, 26, was taken hostage in the Oct. 7 attack alongside her boyfriend, Avinatan Or. Viral footage showed Ms. Argamani being taken into Gaza on the back of a motorcycle as she cried out in desperation. Ms. Argamani and her boyfriend were abducted from the Nova music festival in southern Israel, where militants carried out brutal atrocities against partygoers. The fate of Ms. Argamani’s boyfriend is unknown. The plight of Ms. Argamani received outsize attention, in part because her mother, Liora, has brain cancer and her condition has deteriorated significantly in recent months. “I don’t know how much time I have left,” the mother said last year. “I wish to see my Noa at home.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Ocasio-Cortez Backs N.Y.

ByKaren Zraick A long-shot effort by left-leaning New York state lawmakers to curtail financial support for Israeli settlements has drawn a big-name backer — but she doesn’t have a vote in Albany. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who rarely wades into state politics, publicly backed a bill on Monday that could strip New York nonprofits of their tax-exempt status if their funds are used to support Israel’s military and settlement activity. Her involvement underscores the extent to which the war in Gaza and Israel’s treatment of Palestinians more broadly have animated the left flank of the Democratic Party as a pivotal election approaches. “It is more important now than ever to hold the Netanyahu government accountable for endorsing and, in fact, supporting some of this settler violence that prevents a lasting peace,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said at a news conference. “This bill will make sure that the ongoing atrocities that we see happening in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as the ongoing enabling of armed militias to terrorize Palestinians in the West Bank, do not benefit from New York State charitable tax exemptions.” Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Jabari Brisport introduced the bill, called the “Not on Our Dime” act, months before the Oct. 7 attack, saying it was an effort to prevent tax-exempt donations from subsidizing violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank. It was widely criticized by Albany lawmakers and declared a “nonstarter.” Now its sponsors say they plan to revise the bill to prohibit “aiding and abetting” the resettling of the Gaza Strip or providing “unauthorized support” for Israeli military activity that violates international law. “There’s a newfound consciousness in our country with regards to the urgency of Palestinian human rights, and we have to propose and advocate for legislation that reflects public sentiment,” Mr. Mamdani said in a recent interview, referring to some of Israel’s violence toward people in Gaza and the West Bank as “war crimes.” The lawmakers announced the relaunch of the bill at an event at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s Bronx district office on Monday morning, surrounded by left-leaning elected officials from the City Council and State Legislature. Asked why she had chosen to endorse a state-level bill, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that it was “politically perilous” to do so and that she had wanted to support her colleagues.

ByMichael D. ShearandPeter Baker Reporting from Paris President Biden and President Emmanuel Macron of France stressed on Saturday how much they agreed with each other about world affairs, including the war in Ukraine, even as their countries have expressed sharply different views of the fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. Appearing briefly together in front of reporters after two days of D-Day remembrances and hours before a lavish state dinner at the Élysée Palace in Paris, the two presidents declined to take any questions and papered over their stark differences about the Middle East. Instead, they both asserted the enduring strength of the American-French partnership on climate, the economy, European security and cultural ties. “Today, I proudly stand with France to support freedom and democracy around the world,” Mr. Biden said, as the two men emerged from a closed-door meeting at the Élysée Palace. “We see eye to eye on this war raging in Ukraine,” Mr. Macron noted, and he added that he hoped “all members of the G7 will agree to a $50 billion solidarity fund for Ukraine,” referring to the Group of 7 industrialized nations. The French president’s comments suggested that the two leaders had reached common ground over a plan to leverage proceeds from frozen Russian assets to provide an upfront loan of up to $50 billion to Ukraine. American officials had said heading into the meeting that France was the main holdout for such a plan and that they were hoping to win support during the Paris visit. On Gaza, Mr. Macron noted his government’s support for an Israeli cease-fire proposal that Mr. Biden has strongly backed. But the French president also directly challenged Israel to do more to deliver aid to Palestinians suffering from the government’s bombardment. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMatthew Mpoke BiggandAaron Boxerman A key member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israeli war cabinet who has threatened to depart amid serious differences over the war in Gaza has indefinitely postponed an expected news conference planned for Saturday evening, citing “recent events.” The decision comes as Israeli authorities announced that they had rescued four hostages who had been held in Gaza since Oct. 7 in a “complex” operation in central Gaza. Benny Gantz, a centrist opposition leader, has said he would quit unless Mr. Netanyahu addressed his concerns about how the war would end and what would follow it, with pressure rising on Mr. Netanyahu to wind down the conflict and put forward a detailed plan for governing the territory when fighting ends. Last month, Mr. Gantz said he would resign by Saturday, though there was no public indication of whether he would follow through. If he were to depart, it would be unlikely to force Mr. Netanyahu from office. Mr. Gantz and his party have not been part of the prime minister’s right-wing governing coalition, which has a majority of 64 seats in Israel’s 120-member Parliament. But Mr. Gantz’s threat has again exposed the fractures within Israel’s leadership as frustration grows at home over the failure to decisively defeat Hamas or to bring home all the hostages held in Gaza. Mr. Gantz joined the powerful war cabinet, which makes many of the decisions about the Gaza conflict, after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 assault on Israel, in a demonstration of unity in a crisis. He brought stature to the role as a former military chief of staff, former defense minister and popular opposition figure, seen as the chief political rival to Mr. Netanyahu.

ByGlenn Thrush Reporting from Washington George Clooney contacted a top White House official last month to complain after President Biden criticized the International Criminal Court’s decision toseek a warrantagainst top Israeli officials over the war in Gaza, a case the actor’s wife had worked on, according to two people familiar with the situation. His wife, Amal Clooney, a prominent human rights lawyer, served on an advisory panel that helped conduct the court’s investigation, which resulted in warrant requests for Israel’s prime minister and defense minister and three senior Hamas leaders, accusing them of illegal conduct that has led to thousands of civilian deaths. Mr. Clooney lodged his protest withSteve Ricchetti, a counselor to Mr. Biden who played a pivotal role in his fund-raising efforts four years ago. It had no effect on U.S. policy, a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Nonetheless, Mr. Clooney’s decision to contact the White House (with a text message, one of the people said) underscores the problems that Israel’s actions have caused for Mr. Biden as he tries to reconcile his support for a stalwart ally with his own misgivings and increased pressure from the disillusioned American left. To illustrate that dilemma: Mr. Clooney is scheduled to appear at a high-dollar June 15 fund-raiser for Mr. Biden in Los Angeles, with former President Barack Obama in attendance. In a fund-raising email sent on behalf of the Biden-Harris campaign on Saturday, Mr. Clooney said, “Joe and Kamala’s message of hope and belief in a better future for all is one that I believe in.” Simon Halls, a spokesman for the actor, declined to comment about Mr. Clooney’s interaction with Mr. Ricchetti but said his client “has every intention of attending the fund-raiser.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But the intensity of the attacks has increased in recent days,leading to fears of a full-scale waron another front. This week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel threatened further military action to ensure the return ofcivilians to communities in northern Israel. Here are some key questions about the conflict and where it might be heading: Hezbollah, apowerful Lebanese militia and political movement, launched attacks into Israel on Oct. 8, answering calls by Hamas to open a second front a day after the Palestinian armed group that rules Gaza led a deadly assault on Israel. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran. Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has said that his group is trying to pin Israel’s troops along the border and limit its capacity to attack Hamas in Gaza. Hezbollah’s conflict with Israel goes back decades. Israel has invaded Lebanon three times in the last 50 years, most recently in 2006, when the two sides foughta monthlong warthat killed more than 1,000 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and more than 150 in Israel, mostly soldiers.

ByAlan Rappeport Alan Rappeport reported from Stresa, Italy, where he is covering the Group of 7 finance ministers meeting. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen warned Israel on Thursday againstcutting off tiesbetween Palestinian and Israeli banks, arguing that such a move would further destabilize the economy of the West Bank when Palestinians were already facing dire economic conditions. Ms. Yellen’s comments came in the wake of Israel’s decision on Wednesday to withhold tax revenue from the Palestinian Authority in retaliation for three European countries’ unilaterally agreeing to recognize a Palestinian state. Ms. Yellen and other top economic officials from the Group of 7 nations are expected to discuss the matter and the humanitarian situation in Gaza during their summit in Stresa, Italy, which begins on Thursday. “I’m particularly concerned by Israel’s threats to take action that would lead to Palestinian banks’ being cut off from their Israeli correspondent banks,” Ms. Yellen said during remarks ahead of a news conference. Ms. Yellen added that the banking channels were critical for processing transactions that allow $8 billion a year of imports of food, fuel and electricity from Israel and $2 billion of Palestinian exports. The war in Gaza is one of several geopolitical crises that are weighing on the global economy. The economic policymakers are also planning to discuss Russia’s war in Ukraine and continue deliberations over how to use more than $300 billion of frozen Russian central bank assets to provide Ukraine with additional aid. Officials from the Group of 7 will also be discussing ways to tighten sanctions on Russia and how to prevent China from providing the country with military support. Ms. Yellen said on Thursday that the plight of the Palestinians would be a topic of discussion with her counterparts and that a move to cut Palestinians off from the international financial system could fuel a “humanitarian crisis.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But tensions have mounted over the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and how Europe can step out of America’s shadow. ByRoger CohenandPeter Baker Reporting from Normandy, France In the sunlight of Normandy, before the surviving American veterans who eight decades ago helped turn the tide of the war against Hitler, President Emmanuel Macron of France spoke this past week of the “bond of blood shed for liberty” that ties his country to the United States. It is a bond that goes all the way back to the founding of the United States in 1776 and the decisive French support for American independence against the British. Tempestuous, often strained as France bristles at American postwar leadership in Europe, the ties between Paris and Washington are nonetheless resilient. President Biden’s five-day stay in France, an exceptionally long visit for an American president, especially in an election year, is a powerful testament to that friendship. But it illustrates its double-edged nature. French gratitude for American sacrifice as ever vies uneasily with Gaullist restiveness over any hint of subservience. Those competing strands will form the backdrop of a lavish state dinner at the Élysée Palace on Saturday, when Mr. Macron will reciprocate the state visit that Mr. Bidenhosted for him at the White Housein December 2022, the first of his administration. The toasts and bonhomie will not fully mask the tensions between Washington and Paris — over the war in Gaza, how best to support Ukraine and the unpredictable ways Mr. Macron tries to assert France’s independence from the United States. No recent French president has been as insistent as Mr. Macron in declaring Europe’s need for “strategic autonomy” and insisting that it “should never be a vassal of the United States.” Yet he has stood shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Biden in seeing Ukraine’s fight for freedom against Russia as no less than a battle for European liberty, an extension of the fight for freedom that led allied forces to scale the cliffs of the Pointe du Hoc in 1944.

Netanyahu Is Set to Address Congress on July 24,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/middleeast/netanyahu-address-us-congress.html,2024-06-07T03:29:30+0000,"The political divide over the Israeli prime minister was evident even in the announcement of when he would appear, with Republican and Democratic leaders issuing separate statements.","Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel will address a joint meeting of Congress on July 24, the top two congressional Republicans announced on Thursday night.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement The political divide over the Israeli prime minister was evident even in the announcement of when he would appear, with Republican and Democratic leaders issuing separate statements. ByAnnie Karni Reporting from Washington Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel will address a joint meeting of Congress on July 24, the top two congressional Republicans announced on Thursday night. Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, said in a statement that the speech would offer Mr. Netanyahu the opportunity to “share the Israeli government’s vision for defending their democracy, combating terror, and establishing just and lasting peace in the region.” But in a separate statement that hinted at the deep political divides over Mr. Netanyahu and Israel’s war in Gaza, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said he harbored “clear and profound disagreements with the prime minister, which I have voiced both privately and publicly and will continue to do so.” He said he nevertheless had joined the request for Mr. Netanyahu to address Congress because “America’s relationship with Israel is ironclad and transcends one person or prime minister.” Earlier this year, Mr. Schumer called for Mr. Netanyahu to step down and for Israel to hold new elections. The bipartisan invitation to Mr. Netanyahu, issued last month by the top four congressional leaders with no date attached, masked a fraught behind-the-scenes debate over receiving him. The need for separate statements from the leaders of the two parties explaining their different rationales for extending the invitation underscored those tensions. Some progressives like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont have already promised to boycott the speech, calling Mr. Netanyahu a “war criminal” for his tactics in the war against Hamas, which has killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza and caused a humanitarian disaster. Republicans, in contrast, are eager to hug Mr. Netanyahu close and unequivocally back his policies. Mr. Johnson has been the driving force behind the invitation. “I am very moved to have the privilege of representing Israel before both houses of Congress and to present the truth about our just war against those who seek to destroy us to the representatives of the American people and the entire world,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement accepting the invitation.

Biden and Blinken Accuse I.C.C.

ByMichael D. Shear Reporting from Washington, D.C. President Biden on Monday condemned the decision by the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor to seek arrest warrants for two top Israeli officials — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant — when he requested warrants for the leaders of Hamas, saying ina White House statementthat “whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas.” Mr. Biden’s decision to stand firmly behind Mr. Netanyahu was echoed by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who called the move by the prosecutor, Karim Khan, “shameful” ina statementthat said the United States rejected his “equivalence of Israel with Hamas.” Mr. Blinken accused Mr. Khan of going “on cable television to announce the charges” even as his staff canceled a planned visit to Israel to discuss the I.C.C.’s inquiry into Israel’s conduct of the war. “These and other circumstances call into question the legitimacy and credibility of this investigation,” he said. “It is shameful,” Mr. Blinken said of theprosecutor’s decision to request warrants for leaders of both sides in the conflict,implying their equivalence. “Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization that carried out the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and is still holding dozens of innocent people hostage, including Americans. This decision does nothing to help, and could jeopardize, ongoing efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement that would get hostages out and surge humanitarian assistance in.” The forceful denunciation of the I.C.C. came, however, amid increasing tensions between the United States and Mr. Netanyahu over Israel’s conduct of the war and its preparations for a major offensive into Rafah, a city packed with displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza. Mr. Biden has repeatedly warned Mr. Netanyahu not to take actions that would endanger the hundreds of thousands of civilians sheltering there. Mr. Biden and other administration officials have criticized the Israeli bombardment and invasion of Gaza in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault as causing more casualties and physical destruction than necessary. But Mr. Biden has also said he will not abandon Israel, and has insisted that Mr. Netanyahu and the country’s leaders have a right to defend their people against threats of terrorism. The United States has said in the past that the I.C.C. does not have jurisdiction in the conflict in Israel, which is not a member of the court. In his statement, Mr. Blinken called it a “court of limited jurisdiction” and criticized it for a “rush to seek these arrest warrants.” Hours later, Mr. Blinken’s spokesman at the State Department, Matthew Miller, went further, saying in a press briefing in Washington that “I don’t have any doubt” that the issuing of arrest warrants for the Israeli leaders “will embolden Hamas.” Michael D.

ByZolan Kanno-Youngs Reporting from Washington Follow our live coverage of theverdict in Hunter Biden’s gun trial. President Biden said on Thursday that he would not grant Hunter Biden a pardon if he was convicted in his felony gun trial, a rare comment from Mr. Biden about the legal troubles facing his son. When asked during aninterview with ABC Newswhether he would accept the outcome of thetrial of his son, who faces charges including lying on an application to obtain a gun in October 2018, Mr. Biden said, “Yes.” In the wide-ranging interview, the president also defended his border policies and reiterated his support for a cease-fire proposal in the war in Gaza. When the topic turned to former President Donald J. Trump and his recent felony conviction, Mr. Biden said his opponent needed to “stop undermining the rule of law.” Last week, a New York jury found Mr. Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to a porn actress, in an unlawful conspiracy to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. He has since repeated hiscriticism of the judge in the caseandsuggested he could seek to prosecute his political opponentsif elected again. At acampaign rally in Arizona on Thursday, Mr. Trump called his trial “rigged” and said the charges had been “fabricated.” Mr. Biden took on a sharper edge when asked about his political opponent’s broadsides after a recent executive order allowing thesuspension of asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The former president called the move “weak and pathetic.” “Is he describing himself — weak and pathetic?” Mr. Biden said in the interview, which took place on the sidelines of his visit to the beaches of Normandy in France to observe the 80th anniversary of D-Day.

ByMichael Crowley The U.S. military has repaired a temporary pier for humanitarian relief and on Friday reattached it to the Gaza shore, more than a week after itbroke apart in high seas, the military said. Army Corps Of Engineers workers completed the work on Friday morning, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, told reporters in a briefing call. The $230-million floating pier, which American officials have lauded as part of a solution to getting more aid into hunger-stricken Gaza, has been troubled by logistical and security issues. Admiral Cooper said that aid would begin to flow through the pier again “in the coming days.” He said that military engineers “provided all the necessary support to ensure the safe and placement of the pier to the beach,” adding: “The policy of no U.S. boots on the ground does remain in effect.” White House policy does not allow U.S. troops on the ground in Gaza. Once the aid resumes, Admiral Cooper estimated, about one million pounds of goods would enter Gaza through the pier over each two-day period. In early March, President Biden surprised the Pentagon by announcing that the U.S. military would build a pier for Gaza. In the days after it became operational on May 17, trucks were looted as they made their way to a warehouse, forcing the U.N. World Food Program tosuspend operations. After officials beefed up security, the weather turned bad. American officials had been hoping that the sea surges would not start until later in the summer. The situation in Gaza remains dire. Health officials say more than 36,000 people have been killed; many people have been displaced; and the United Nations has warned that famine is looming.

ByErika SolomonandAbu Bakr Bashir A mother begs her dead child to take her hand. A young man, wrapped in bandages, lies weeping next to the corpse of another man. A little boy, his face coated in dust and blood, stares vacantly from a hospital floor as people shout frantically around him. The scenes at the doorstep of the last functioning hospital in central Gaza, posted on social media by a Palestinian videographer after an Israeli strike hit a United Nations school complex, have yet again highlighted the awful dilemma that Palestinian civilians keep facing through eight months of war: The places where they seek refuge often end up being attacked. The videos were posted to Instagram on Thursday after the strike. The New York Times verified that they were shot at Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al Balah. In the early morning hours of Thursday, Israel launched a strike on a school complex housing thousands of displaced Palestinians who had sought shelter there. Dozens were killed. Israel says its attack targeted and killed Hamas operatives using the school building as a base. Palestinian medical workers say it killed civilians. Of at least 40 dead bodies from the attack registered by Gaza’s Health Ministry, 14 were children and nine were women, the ministry said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

In closely coordinated announcements, the leaders of the three countries said that Palestinian independence cannot wait for a negotiated peace deal with Israel’s right-wing government, which largely opposes a two-state solution, has been expanding settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and is continuing to bombard Gaza without either toppling Hamas or bringing home all its hostages. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has also frustrated world leaders — and two members of his war cabinet — with his refusal to establish a postwar plan to govern Gaza, where the health authorities say that more than 35,000 people have been killed. Simon Harris, the Irish prime minister, linked his government’s decision to Ireland’s quest for independence from Britain. “From our own history, we know what it means: Recognition is an act of powerful political and symbolic value,” he said at a news briefing. The announcements by all three countries came just days after the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutorrequested arrest warrantsfor Mr. Netanyahu and Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, on suspicion of war crimes.

ByMarc Tracy This winter, a guest curator selected nearly 70 artworks to include in the California Jewish Open, an exhibition starting Thursday at San Francisco’sContemporary Jewish Museum.More than 500 Jewish-identifying artists in the state had submitted works under the general theme of “connection.” Many pieces were apolitical. Some articulated support for Israel. Others expressed solidarity with Palestinians. Executives and curators had expected jostling perspectives when they issued an open call in November, at a moment the American Jewish community was already splintering over Israel’s military response in Gaza to Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks. What they did not foresee, though, was that after the selections were made in February, seven artists (two worked as a pair) would pull their six works out of the show in April following back-and-forths with the museum. The artists made demands, including wanting control of their works’ presentation, institutional divestment by the museum from companies that do business with Israel and boycotting Israel itself. Now, visitors will see, alongside the 63 works by 47 artists in the exhibition, six wall spaces left intentionally blank by curators — preserved, according to accompanying text, “to honor the perspectives that would have been shared through these artworks, and to authentically reflect the struggle for dialogue that is illustrated by the artists’ decisions to withdraw.” The dispute and the museum’s response go to the heart of a debate over how institutions ought to lend voice to dissent and how artists might balance the idea of expressing their disagreement by pulling out of a show against remaining in the exhibition as dissenters.

Getting a Cease-Fire in Gaza Has Been Hard.

But Israel rejects a permanent cease-fire and Hamas has its own reasons for reluctance. BySteven Erlanger Steven Erlanger, a former Jerusalem bureau chief who has spent many weeks in the Middle East since Oct. 7, reported from Jerusalem. Even as Hamas and the Israeli government appear to be inching closer to a cease-fire agreement, analysts are deeply skeptical that the sides will ever implement a deal that goes beyond a temporary truce. At issue is a three-phase agreement, proposed by Israel and backed by the United States and some Arab countries, which if fully realized could eventually see the total withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, the return of all remaining hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attack and a reconstruction plan for the territory. But making it to that finish line is impossible if the parties are unwilling to even start the race or to agree on where it should end. Fundamentally, the wrangling is not just about how long a cease-fire in Gaza should last or at what point it should be implemented, but whether Israel can ever accept a long-term truce as long as Hamas retains significant control. For Israel to agree to Hamas’s demands for a permanent cease-fire from the start, it must acknowledge that Hamas will remain undestroyed and will play a role in the territory’s future, conditions Israel’s government cannot abide. On the flip side, Hamas says it won’t consider a temporary cease-fire without the guarantees of a permanent one that effectively ensures its survival, even at the cost of countless more Palestinian lives, lest Israel restart the war once its hostages are returned. Yet after eight months of a grinding war, there are signs that the sides could be moving closer to the first proposed phase: a six-week conditional cease-fire. While that step is hardly guaranteed, getting to the plan’s second phase, which envisages a permanent cessation of hostilities and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, is even more unlikely, analysts said. “It is wrong to see this proposal as more than a stopgap,” said Natan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. “Most important, this plan doesn’t answer the fundamental question of who rules Gaza after the conflict. This is a cease-fire plan, not a day-after plan.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

ByMatthew Mpoke Bigg President Biden raised hopes last week when he endorsed a plan that he said could lead to a “cessation of hostilities permanently.” He said Israel had put forward the plan, but neither Israel nor Hamas has said definitively that they would accept or reject the proposal, and they appear to still be locked in disagreement over fundamental issues. Here’s a look at what is known about the cease-fire deal, which key points still must be negotiated, and the hurdles still ahead: Israel and Hamas agreed to a cease-fire in November that lasted for a week. But the proposal now on the table — as laid out by Mr. Biden, a senior U.S. administration official and Israeli officials — is more ambitious. Major issues remain unresolved, including whether Hamas would remain in control of the Gaza Strip. The proposalwould unfold in three phases. Inphase one, among other things, Israel would withdraw from population centers in Gaza during a six-week cease-fire, and dozens of women and elderly hostages held in Gaza by Hamas and its allies would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons. During that time, talks over a permanent cease-fire would continue, and if successful, the deal would enter phase two, with the full withdrawal of Israel’s military from the enclave. All hostages and more Palestinian prisoners would be freed. Under phase three, Hamas would return the bodies of hostages who had died, and a three- to five-year reconstruction period, backed by the United States, European countries and international institutions, would begin. One of the key gaps between Hamas and Israel over the plan is the length of the cease-fire and the future role of Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Monday that he was open to a six-week cease-fire, according to a person who attended a closed-door meeting he held with Israeli lawmakers. But publicly he has said that Israel will fight until Hamas’s governing and military capabilities are destroyed. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByKurt Streeter Reporting from the University of California, Berkeley. Waves of boos, angry chants and the steady rhythm of feet pounding on metal seats were upending the graduation ceremony at the University of California, Berkeley. “Viva, viva Palestina!” students sang out. “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Israel’s apartheid has got to go!” It was the soundtrack of this year’s antiwar protest, voiced on the morning of May 11 by hundreds of cap-and-gowned graduates, loud enough to nearly drown out the ceremony’s official speakers — and force the event to halt. One minute passed. Two minutes. Five. It looked like Berkeley’s 2024 commencement was about to be canceled midstream. Then, suddenly, surprisingly, the ceremony resumed. Once it was over and most had left the school’s low-slung football stadium, Berkeley’s chancellor, Carol Christ, sat near the podium in a folding chair. She is silver-haired and soft-spoken, a soon-to-retire 80-year-old former English professor with an unusual background for the modern college president: Her views on free speech first crystallized during her years as a student protester in the turbulent 1960s. When the demonstrators forced the pause, had she considered ending the event? “Absolutely not,” Dr. Christ said. This is Berkeley, she said. “We were always going to power through. Protest is part of our core.” Dr. Christ (her name rhymes with “wrist”) plans to retire at the end of June. The first woman appointed to the job, she leaves as the oldest chancellor in Berkeley history, and one of the oldest leaders of an elite college campus in America.

Family members first saw the footage a few weeks ago via the Israeli military, which formally handed them a copy on Tuesday night, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents families of hostages held captive in Gaza. “I’m asking you, please show this clip every day, open your broadcasts with it,” Eli Albag, whose daughter Liri Albag can be seenin the video, said in a television interview with Israel’s Channel 12. “Until somebody wakes up, the nation wakes up, and realizes that they’ve been abandoned there for 229 days.” On Thursday, the day after the video was made public, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that Israel’s war cabinet had ordered its negotiators to “continue talks to bring home the hostages” held in Gaza. But hopes for immediate progress appeared remote in the shadow of Israel’s ongoing military operation in Rafah, in southern Gaza, from which over 800,000 Palestinians have fled, according to the United Nations. Some Israeli politicians immediately seized on the video on Wednesday to try to rebuff the decision by Ireland, Norway, and Spain tounilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. Israel Katz, the foreign minister, said he would screen the footage during a “severe reprimand” of the countries’ ambassadors. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByHeather Knight Reporting from Stanford University Police officers arrested 13 people on Wednesday after pro-Palestinian protesters barricaded themselves in the office of the president of Stanford University and demanded that administrators meet several demands, including a vote by the university trustees on whether to divest from companies that are said to support Israel's military. The administration offices, located in Building 10, were cleared within about three hours, according to Dee Mostofi, a campus spokeswoman, who said that there was “extensive damage.” Several sandstone walls and pillars on the exterior of buildings on the university’s historic Main Quad were marked with graffiti that criticized the police, Stanford, Israel and the United States. Protesters had entered the building around 5:30 a.m. on Wednesday, and university police officers arrived at the scene after they were alerted of the occupation, according to Ms. Mostofi. The building houses the offices of the university’s president, Richard Saller, and provost, Jenny Martinez, among others. One officer was injured during the arrests, Ms. Mostofi said, adding that any students who were arrested will be suspended and those who are seniors will not be allowed to graduate. “We are appalled that our students chose to take this action, and we will work with law enforcement to ensure that they face the full consequences allowed by law,” Ms. Mostofi said in a statement. Wednesday is the final day of classes for the spring quarter at Stanford. A security guard stationed on the Main Quad warned students who were bicycling or walking to their last classes of the academic year that they would see disturbing graffiti.

Hey, it’s Michael. Before we start today, we wanted to invite you to something really special. The legendary Tribeca Festival is starting a brand new annual gala to celebrate excellence in audio. And for this, the inaugural year, they’ve chosen to celebrate “The Daily.” We know that you, our incredible audience, are all over the world, but we’d like you to join us. The Gala is in New York on June 9th at 5:00 PM. You can get all the details and buy tickets at tribecafilm.com/thedaily. That’s tribecafilm.com/thedaily. I’m going to be there. So is Sabrina, along with a bunch of us from the show. Mo Rocca is going to host it. So if you’re in the area or visiting, we’d love to see you there. OK, on with today’s show. From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise. And this is “The Daily.” [MUSIC PLAYING] In an unexpected speech last week, President Biden revealed the details of a secret proposal intended to end the war in Gaza. Most surprising was where that proposal had come from. Today, my colleague Isabel Kershner explains Biden’s gambit and the difficult choice it presents for Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. It’s Wednesday, June 5. Isabel, tell us about this speech from President Biden last Friday at the White House. So last Friday, President Biden made a speech. And it came at a pivotal moment in the war because for weeks beforehand, the whole world had been focused on Israel’s long delayed invasion of the city of Rafah, the southernmost city in the Gaza Strip and also the city that about a million displaced Palestinians had fled to to find refuge from fighting in other areas of the Gaza Strip. So understandably, there was huge concern internationally and particularly a lot of pressure coming from the White House for Israel not to go into Rafah. It was just considered way too risky. But for the Israelis, they were saying the last battalions of Hamas are there. Many hostages are there. And without taking control of that area, the Israelis felt they wouldn’t have accomplished anything. So in the end, they did begin to move into the Eastern part of Rafah. But then as the Israelis were operating in Eastern Rafah with their tanks and ground troops, the Israelis on May 26 carried out a strike, an airstrike. This was an attack meant to target two Hamas operatives. And they did, in fact, strike those two operatives and killed them with what they said were the smallest missiles that their jets could carry. Unfortunately, that strike then set off an absolutely devastating fire because the area the strike took place in is right by a camp of makeshift shacks and tents where hundreds or thousands of Palestinians were sheltering. This fire ripped through the tents and ended up killing 45 civilians according to the Gazan health authorities. And it was exactly the kind of disaster that everybody had feared if Israel were to operate in this crowded, southern, dusty border town. Which presumably put a lot more pressure on the Biden White House to do something about this war. That’s right. Now, we know that the White House, the Biden administration, would very much like to see this war come to an end as soon as possible. And then on Friday — Good afternoon. Before I begin my remarks — — President Biden gives a speech. And surprisingly — Now to another issue. — this speech when it turns to the Israel-Hamas war was not about Rafah. In fact, it was something totally different and much bigger. Israel has now offered — Israel is offering a comprehensive new proposal. It’s a road map to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages. What President Biden described as the outline of an Israeli proposal for a ceasefire truce and hostage release deal with Hamas that would end the war. This proposal has been transmitted by Qatar to Hamas. Today, I want to lay out his terms for the American citizens and for the world. And, Isabel, what did he mean exactly by the Israeli proposal? Well, there’s been a lot of smoke and mirrors around this whole process of talks and negotiations between Israel and Hamas. And, in fact, the last time we saw a negotiation actually result in a temporary cease fire and a partial hostage release was at the end of last November. But, in fact, there had been this on again, off again attempt at getting negotiations back on track over the last few weeks. And it soon came to light that this was the latest Israeli proposal that was apparently presented. And this proposal it turns out was unanimously approved as a basis for the negotiation by Israel’s war cabinet. And here is an American president spelling out this previously undisclosed Israeli position on television. Absolutely. And the Israeli public knew nothing about this. So what does Biden actually say? What does he say is in this proposal? OK, well, what he says — This new proposal has three phases. Three. He presents it as a deal in three phases, which is generally in line with all the previous plans of the last few months. And the first phase would involve a six week temporary ceasefire during which a certain number of hostages — — including women, the elderly, the wounded — — the most vulnerable ones — There are American hostages who would be released at this stage. And we want them home. — would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. And Israeli forces would be withdrawing from population centers within the Gaza Strip. — with 600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every single day. Humanitarian aid would be flowing at a much greater level and generally the beginning of a change in atmosphere and climate. So this seems in some ways like the temporary ceasefire in November, right? Women and children, vulnerable hostages, a cease in hostilities for six weeks. What about phase two? Well, here we get to the crucial part because during phase one, the sides are supposed to start negotiating phase two. Now, I’ll be straight with you. There are a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two. And phase two is supposed to culminate in all remaining living hostages released and exchanged again for many more Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. This would involve also the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. And in his speech, President Biden does say that as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary ceasefire would become, in the words of the Israeli proposal — — the cessation of hostilities permanently.” — essentially meaning the end of the war. So Biden is actually talking about the end of the war. He’s saying that out loud, which is not something we’ve been hearing from Israel at all, at least publicly. On the contrary, in fact, our colleagues wrote a story at the end of last week when one senior Israeli official said the war would last until at least the end of the year. So this is something very new. Absolutely. And then we get to phase three because there’s a third phase to this plan. And that is moving ahead already to the day after the war, which has been kept very vague by the Israelis up to now. And the phase that President Biden outlined was essentially just for a major reconstruction plan for Gaza. That’s the offer that’s now on the table and what we’ve been asking for. It’s what we need. So the president is saying that this is a deal that should be accepted, that meets the requirements of both sides, that can point to a path forward. And he makes a couple of points to bolster that — The people of Israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they’ve devastated Hamas forces. — one of which is that in his view, Hamas has already been sufficiently degraded and devastated to the point where, as President Biden puts it, Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another October 7. In other words, that goal of total victory that Netanyahu talks about, Biden is actually saying they’ve accomplished it. The Israelis have accomplished it. Not really, actually. He takes on Netanyahu on the total victory slogan — Indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will not bring Israel and will not bring down — will only bog down Israel in Gaza, draining the economic, military, and human resources and furthering Israel’s isolation in the world. — and says that total victory is a kind of nebulous and unrealistic goal that would basically mean indefinite war because what does total victory mean? You can’t kill every last Hamas operative. And even if you did, presumably there would be many more Palestinians who would come to replace them. And in a way, he’s using this speech to go over the head of Netanyahu and go straight to the Israeli people and present them with these terms to in a way corner Netanyahu, but also to put down the gauntlet to Hamas and say, here are the terms. They sound very like the terms Hamas was asking for and putting Hamas equally on the spot to come back to the table even though Israel is still fighting in Rafah. It’s time to begin this new stage, for the hostages to come home, for Israel to be secure, for the suffering to stop. It’s time for this war to end, for the day after to begin. Thank you very much. So Biden is essentially saying here, listen. Israel, you have won the war effectively. Hamas is degraded. Now it’s time to accept the ceasefire deal that you yourself have designed. What was the reaction inside Israel? The initial reaction took a while to come because President Biden made his speech. And it landed at about 8:30 in the evening on Friday Israel time. And this is the time where many, many families are sitting around their Sabbath dinner table, as I was with my family and friends, not watching the news, not looking at phones for the most part. Observant Jews have actually switched off for the Sabbath and aren’t going to hear any news until Saturday night. And as the news did begin to trickle out, it really shook Israel up. And this leaves Netanyahu in a great bind because for months, he’s really been playing for time and juggling competing interests and really not having to make a decision one way or the other on what comes next. We’ve been hearing that Rafah is really the last stronghold of Hamas, and this is something the military has to do. But after that, there was just a kind of void and no news on the hostages or a ceasefire or a deal on the horizon. And so when this speech was made, suddenly it shook up everything. And Netanyahu is suddenly facing a very crucial choice. We’ll be right back. So, Isabel, you said that this is a very important moment for Netanyahu, that now he really is facing a choice. What does he do? What does he come out and say? So his office actually put out a statement. And his first response was that Israel is sticking to its objectives of the destruction of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. And he said the actual proposal put forward by Israel would allow Israel to uphold these principles. Now, this was a slightly ambiguous response that you could pass in different ways. He wasn’t exactly denying that this was an Israeli proposal. And indeed, we quickly learned that, in fact, Israel’s war cabinet had unanimously voted on the general outlines of what President Biden had presented. He wasn’t denying it. But the one thing missing from that statement was this declaration we’d been hearing for months on end that the war wouldn’t end until there was total victory. That had gone. So total victory had gone, which is a difference, which means potentially the war goals have shifted a little bit. Well, the way he articulated it is talking about the degradation or dismantling of Hamas’s capabilities as opposed to talking about the total elimination of Hamas as a movement. And then he followed up. His office put out another statement on Saturday, also still during the Sabbath, which was a little stronger. He said under the proposal, Israel would insist on its conditions being met, these same war objectives, before a permanent cease fire is put in place and that any suggestion that Israel would agree to that permanent ceasefire before the conditions are met would be a non-starter. But again, it was kind of conditional and could be interpreted in different ways. At what point does one declare that the capabilities have been dismantled or sufficiently degraded? So it left a lot of room for maneuver. And so what is Netanyahu up to here, Isabel? I think he’s trying to balance all these competing sides. He’s seems to be trying not to torpedo the chances of this deal but at the same time to be able to hang on politically when he has a very serious challenge looming within his government should this deal go ahead. So tell me about that challenge. Israel’s government is formed of a coalition of parties. Netanyahu’s Likud is the main party. But it totally relies for its majority in parliament on its partners in the coalition. And they include two ultra-orthodox parties and two far right parties. And the far right parties have both come out explicitly saying that should this deal as outlined by President Biden go ahead, they will not be party to it. So Netanyahu faces this real political danger on his right. That’s right. So there are the leaders of these two right wing parties who he relies on for his coalition government. He relies on them for his majority in parliament. And the leaders of those parties are Itamar Ben-Gvir, who’s the national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich, who is currently the finance minister. Now, neither of these parties nor their leaders are sitting in the much more tight and small war cabinet that actually oversees and directs and makes the decisions on the course of the war in Gaza. They were seen as way too extreme to be part of that forum. That forum is much more reflective of the national consensus. But these parties are part of the broader government. And they have threatened not only to oppose the deal as outlined by President Biden should it go ahead. But they have actually vowed if it does go ahead, they would withdraw their support to Netanyahu and bring his government down. And if his government were to collapse as a result, he would then be facing a new election. Now, he has been trying to stave off the end of the war and the prospect of new elections ever since October 7 because then he’s in danger of facing that public reckoning for the perceived failures that the government’s policy failures, the military’s failures, the intelligence failures leading up to the Hamas led attack of October the 7. But we really might be getting to crunch time when it comes to his political lifeline here. So this is a pretty dramatic moment for Netanyahu then, right? I mean, he’s under tremendous pressure from Biden, his biggest ally. Biden’s basically asking him to choose between this deal, which means the end of the war, something his coalition partners, these hard right guys, really don’t want, and his own power essentially, right? Staying alive politically or the end of the war and the hostages coming home. That is a very stark choice. Absolutely. And then there are other choices that he has to weigh because Israel has been increasingly isolated and under international censure for its prosecution of the war in Gaza. Netanyahu himself is facing the prospect of possible arrest warrants being put out against him from the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Israel is in the dark on a genocide case in the International Court of Justice in the Hague. So should he go ahead with this deal, he has been offered sweeteners like an invitation to address congress. And this would in a way be a way of bringing him back into the fold. So, Isabel, say Netanyahu approves this proposal. How likely is it that the right wing, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, actually do leave the government? I mean, they would be giving up power, too, no? They would. And if we look at all the opinion polls being done in Israel in the last few months, Bezalel Smotrich and his religious Zionism party for one would barely scrape back into parliament in another election. And therefore, there’s a lot at stake for him, too, and for Itamar Ben-Gvir because if the next government that’s formed is not going to be a right wing and far right government, he would find himself out of power, too. But, Isabel, let’s say they do leave. What happens in that scenario? Well, the assumption is that the government would collapse. It would lose its majority. And naturally, the Knesset would vote to dissolve itself and set a date for a new election, which would have to come within five months. And during that period, this government would turn into a caretaker government. Now, usually a caretaker government that’s a transitional one in that period before elections isn’t supposed to make dramatic decisions for the country. But being a caretaker government during wartime, this puts Israel in uncharted political territory. Then theoretically, if we were to ask could such a government even approve a deal once it had been negotiated, even without the support of those far right parties, apparently there would still be enough in favor to see it through. Interesting. So it seems like there are a lot of possibilities for how this could go. But it does in a way rely on Netanyahu deciding what Israel’s course will be. And it seems like he probably needs to land on one of these options. What do you think he’s going to do? Well, it might not end up being black and white, take the deal or not take the deal. We might end up seeing something in between because I think Netanyahu, who is facing huge public pressure to bring back those hostages who still are alive, would definitely want to move ahead with at least that first part of the deal that would see a six week temporary ceasefire in return for the most vulnerable hostages. And then you get into the much trickier part of that negotiation for the next stage, which would involve essentially ending the war. And it could be that we might see Netanyahu wanting to proceed with this deal but only partially and then get to a point where it can’t go further. And Netanyahu is probably very keenly aware of the American political timetable. There are skeptics here who say that by Labor Day, all the American attention is going to be focused on America’s own internal politics running up to the November elections and that Netanyahu basically just has to survive another 90 days to get to that point, at which point the pressure subsides. So this is a scenario in which he just basically runs out the clock. He keeps on that tightrope. That’s a possibility, absolutely, and one that he would be very adept at doing if the past is anything to go by. OK, so there are a number of ways Netanyahu could actually handle this. How should we think about what Biden has really accomplished here? Well, I think it’s hard to say that one speech is going to change the course or the outcome of this war. But it certainly has crystallized the issues and brought them out into the light after months and months of murkiness that Netanyahu was able to in a way hide behind and operate within. And I think now he’s in the spotlight. And assuming that Hamas is willing to accept and go along with this negotiation for this proposal, the Israeli public’s expectations have certainly been risen now toward a deal. And all eyes are now on Netanyahu to see which way he will go. Isabel, thank you. Thank you so much. In an interview with “Time Magazine” published on Tuesday, Biden was asked whether Netanyahu was prolonging the war in Gaza in an effort to hold on to office. Biden said, quote, “There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.” We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you should know today. On Tuesday, Republican lawmakers in Arizona voted to put a ballot measure before voters in November that would make unlawfully crossing the border from Mexico a crime in the state. The move would put the border crisis directly onto the ballot in a key swing state, potentially firing up anti-immigration conservative voters. It is similar to a law passed in Texas earlier this year, currently held up in court after it was challenged by the Biden administration. And the results of a major election in India have been tallied. And they are deeply disappointing for India’s prime minister Narendra Modi. Modi appeared to have secured a third consecutive term in office. However, his BJP party did not deliver the landslide victory it had promised and even lost its majority in parliament. Now Modi and the BJP must come to an agreement with other parties in order to form a coalition government in India’s parliamentary system.

Observant Jews have actually switched off for the Sabbath and aren’t going to hear any news until Saturday night. And as the news did begin to trickle out, it really shook Israel up. And this leaves Netanyahu in a great bind because for months, he’s really been playing for time and juggling competing interests and really not having to make a decision one way or the other on what comes next. We’ve been hearing that Rafah is really the last stronghold of Hamas, and this is something the military has to do. But after that, there was just a kind of void and no news on the hostages or a ceasefire or a deal on the horizon. And so when this speech was made, suddenly it shook up everything. And Netanyahu is suddenly facing a very crucial choice. We’ll be right back. So, Isabel, you said that this is a very important moment for Netanyahu, that now he really is facing a choice. What does he do? What does he come out and say? So his office actually put out a statement. And his first response was that Israel is sticking to its objectives of the destruction of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. And he said the actual proposal put forward by Israel would allow Israel to uphold these principles. Now, this was a sligh",The New York Times
U.S. Counterterrorism Chief Is Stepping Down,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/us/politics/us-counterterrorism-chief-resigns.html,2024-06-05T16:30:57+0000,"The official, Christine Abizaid, recently warned that the Hamas attacks in Israel, and the Gaza conflict, had energized terrorist threats worldwide.","The director of the National Counterterrorism Center will step down next month, Biden administration officials said on Wednesday.","Advertisement Supported by The official, Christine Abizaid, recently warned that the Hamas attacks in Israel, and the Gaza conflict, had energized terrorist threats worldwide. ByEric Schmitt Reporting from Washington The director of the National Counterterrorism Center will step down next month, Biden administration officials said on Wednesday. The director, Christine S. Abizaid, has served three years as the country’s top counterterrorism official. In recent years, a resurgent China and Russia, as well as the wars in Ukraine and in Gaza, have replaced counterterrorism as the country’s main national security priorities. But speaking to asecurity conferencein Doha, Qatar, last month, Ms. Abizaid warned that the Hamas attacks against Israel on Oct. 7, and the ensuing Gaza conflict, had energized an increasingly diverse set of worldwide terrorist threats. The Islamic State no longer controls vast swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria, but its fighters and groups aligned with Al Qaeda are on the march in Africa. The Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan,ISIS Khorasan, dramatically demonstrated its expanding reach earlier this year, conducting deadly attacks inIranandRussia. In addition to supporting Hamas in Gaza, Iran backs extremist groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. “We are in an elevated global threat environment,” Ms. Abizaid said at the conference. Ms. Abizaid, 45, had previously served as a senior counterterrorism official at the White House and as a senior Pentagon official for Southwest Asia policy before taking over the counterterrorism center in June 2021. The counterterrorism center, created in the wake of the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, integrates, analyzes and shares counterterrorism information to address threats. “Christy Abizaid is an extraordinary leader who is not only incredibly effective but principled, courageous and kind,” Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement. Ms. Abizaid started her government career as a counterterrorism intelligence analyst at the Defense Intelligence Agency, specializing in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as the Middle East, and including a tour as the agency’s senior representative in Iraq. She is the daughter of John P. Abizaid, a retired Army general who formerly led the Pentagon’s Central Command, overseeing military operations in the Middle East and parts of Asia. “Christy has played an indispensable role in driving the counterterrorism enterprise for the U.S. government even as other high-priority national security challenges draw resources and attention,” said Nicholas J. Rasmussen, a former director of the counterterrorism center who is now at the Homeland Security Department. Brett M. Holmgren, the assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research, will serve as the acting director of the counterterrorism center when Ms. Abizaid departs in mid-July, administration officials said.

ByBilal Shbair,Hiba Yazbek,Adam RasgonandMichael Levenson Bilal Shbair reported from the central Gaza Strip. After eight months of devastating bombardment by Israeli forces, some Gazans are urging Hamas to accept a cease-fire plan outlined by President Biden, but many remain deeply skeptical that the United States, as Israel’s chief ally, would truly bring an end to the war. “I am hopeful that Hamas will accept this deal,” said Ayman Skeik, a 31-year-old merchant driven out of his home in Gaza City by the fighting. “But I am still scared it would not be achieved.” Like other Gazans, Mr. Skeik, who is now sheltering in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, said he had grown frustrated by the long and generally fruitless cease-fire talks. He noted pointedly that months ago, in February,Mr. Biden suggestedthat a deal was imminent. “The United States used to have a strong word when it wanted to stop any crisis in the world,” Mr. Skeik said. “But nowadays, I see a different thing.” Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr. Biden said that Hamas was no longer capable of carrying out a major terrorist attack on Israel like the one on Oct. 7 and that it was “time to end this war.” He described what he said was a three-phase Israeli plan submitted to Hamas last week that would secure the release of the remaining hostages seized on Oct. 7 and ultimately lead to the “cessation of hostilities permanently” and the rebuilding of Gaza.

After 50 years of failure to stop violence and terrorism against Palestinians by Jewish ultranationalists, lawlessness has become the law. Credit... Supported by ByRonen BergmanandMark Mazzetti   This story is told in three parts. The first documents the unequal system of justice that grew around Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank. The second shows how extremists targeted not only Palestinians but also Israeli officials trying to make peace. The third explores how this movement gained control of the state itself. Taken together, they tell the story of how a radical ideology moved from the fringes to the heart of Israeli political power.  By the end of October, it was clear that no one was going to help the villagers of Khirbet Zanuta. A tiny Palestinian community, some 150 people perched on a windswept hill in the West Bank near Hebron, it had long faced threats from the Jewish settlers who had steadily encircled it. But occasional harassment and vandalism, in the days after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, escalated into beatings and murder threats. The villagers made appeal after appeal to the Israeli police and to the ever-present Israeli military, but their calls for protection went largely unheeded, and the attacks continued with no consequences. So one day the villagers packed what they could, loaded their families into trucks and disappeared. Who bulldozed the village after that is a matter of dispute. The Israeli Army says it was the settlers; a senior Israeli police officer says it was the army. Either way, soon after the villagers left, little remained of Khirbet Zanuta besides the ruins of a clinic and an elementary school. One wall of the clinic, leaning sideways, bore a sign saying that it had been funded by an agency of the European Union providing “humanitarian support for Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank.” Near the school, someone had planted the flag of Israel as another kind of announcement: This is Jewish land now. Such violence over the decades in places like Khirbet Zanuta is well documented. But protecting the people who carry out that violence is the dark secret of Israeli justice. The long arc of harassment, assault and murder of Palestinians by Jewish settlers is twinned with a shadow history, one of silence, avoidance and abetment by Israeli officials. For many of those officials, it is Palestinian terrorism that most threatens Israel. But in interviews with more than 100 people — current and former officers of the Israeli military, the National Israeli Police and the Shin Bet domestic security service; high-ranking Israeli political officials, including four former prime ministers; Palestinian leaders and activists; Israeli human rights lawyers; American officials charged with supporting the Israeli-Palestinian partnership — we found a different and perhaps even more destabilizing threat. A long history of crime without punishment, many of those officials now say, threatens not only Palestinians living in the occupied territories but also the State of Israel itself.

ByRaja AbdulrahimandLauren Leatherby Residents who returned to the northern Gaza town of Jabaliya on Friday had expected to find mass devastation but said they were still shocked by the level of ruin they saw after three weeks of an Israeli offensive on the dense, urban area. “The destruction is indescribable,” said Mohammad Awais, who returned with his family to their home in Jabaliya on Friday. “Our minds aren’t able to comprehend what we’re seeing.” He said he and his family walked along devastated roads for nearly an hour in the heat and saw that no vehicle could navigate streets blocked by piles of rubble from homes and shops that had been destroyed by the Israeli military. As they walked, rescue workers passed, carrying the wounded and bodies of those killed on stretchers. Some bodies were found in the streets, others had been dug out and pulled from the rubble — already beginning to decompose, said Mr. Awais, a social media marketer. “Even the ambulances can’t drive through them to transport the injured and martyrs,” he said of the streets in Jabaliya. The Israeli military said on Friday that it had finished its offensive in eastern Jabaliya and withdrawn after recovering the bodies of seven hostages, killing hundreds of fighters and destroying several miles of an underground tunnel network.

ByCassandra Vinograd Three European nations formally recognized an independent Palestinian state on Tuesday, drawing the ire of Israel as it continued to press its military offensive in Gaza. The previously announced moves by Spain, Norway and Ireland arelargely symbolic, but serve as a rebuke to Israel in the face of mounting international frustration over the country’s military offensive in Gaza and its occupation of Palestinian territories over the years. They also come amid global outrage over an Israeli airstrike on Sunday thatkilled dozens of peopleat a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah, despite international calls for the military to curb its offensive in the southern Gaza city. Growing concern over the civilian death toll could prompt more nations to follow suit, analysts say. Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, on TuesdayaccusedSpain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, of complicity in incitement against Jews for his role in recognizing a Palestinian state. But Mr. Sánchez rejected that claim in an address on Tuesday ahead of a cabinet vote on the matter, calling the recognition a matter of “historical justice” and a “necessity” in order to achieve peace. “The recognition of Palestine is not against anyone, least of all Israel, a friendly nation that Spain values and holds in high regard and with whom we aim to foster the strongest possible relationship,” he said on the steps of Moncloa Palace, the prime minister’s residence, in Madrid. “Furthermore, our decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization that is against a two-state solution.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByAlissa J. Rubin Reporting from Baghdad Iraqis have known the bitter taste of war so intimately and frequently over the past 40 years that they say they can feel viscerally the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. They remember the dreaded whistling of a shell before impact, the fear of a knock at the door bringing word of a loved one’s loss, the stench of blood drying on concrete. This was daily life for many Iraqis for years as an insurgent struggle against the American occupation and a civil war between Sunni and Shia Muslims brought destruction and death to their neighborhoods, shattered families and left behind countless widows and orphans. Those memories initially prompted thousands of peopleto join demonstrationson the streets of Iraq’s cities to show their solidarity with the Palestinian cause. But as the war in Gaza dragged on, those displays of support faded. “You want to help,” said Yasmine Salih, a 25-year old dental student, referring to the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza, “but you can’t because your own bucket of troubles is full.” Nowhere is that sense more vivid than in Baghdad’s historic Adhamiyah neighborhood, where most people follow the Sunni branch of Islam — as do most Palestinians. A number here took up arms against the American military occupation of Iraq that began in 2003, and they view the Israeli assaults on Gaza as a similar fight against an occupying force. Many people in the neighborhood cheered when they heard the news of the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7. But since then, the crowds have dwindled, partly because of a recognition that their efforts could do little to help Palestinians, residents say. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMaia Coleman In some ways, a walkout by pro-Palestinian students at the City University of New York School of Law’s commencement on Thursday was part of the unique political moment that has marked the Class of 2024’s graduation season at so many universities. But CUNY law students were also carrying on something of a graduation tradition at their school. Students chanted pro-Palestinian messages, waved painted banners as they walked across the stage and turned their backs to the law school’s dean, Sudha Setty, during her remarks onstage at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. Then, after the last degrees had been conferred, dozens of students rose from their seats and walked out, joined by a handful of professors and guests. “It reminded me so much of why I came to CUNY Law,” Ale Humano, one of the graduates who walked out of the ceremony, said. The walkout on Thursday is not the first time that tensions over Israel have taken center stage during a commencement ceremony for the New York City public law school. The school, which is known for fostering public interest lawyers, has been a hot spot for pro-Palestinian activism for years, and its graduation ceremonies have recently become the site of conflict over politics related to Israel. For the past two years, law school commencement speakers have made support for Palestinians and opposition to Israel a focus of their speeches,eliciting criticism from public officials, who called the speeches antisemitic. In 2023, Fatima Mousa Mohammed, a Yemeni immigrant and an activist devoted to the Palestinian cause,denounced “Israeli settler colonialism” in her address. The speech set off furious coverage and a wave of public criticism, including from Mayor Eric Adams, who spoke at the same ceremony and condemned the speech’s “divisiveness.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByEmma Bubola Scores of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, but Norway’s announcement on Wednesday that it would do so carried added significance because it hosted the clandestine meetings in 1993 that led to the Oslo Accords, the framework for peace that came close to resolving the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Itultimately failed. Norway calls itself a friend of Israel, and the two countries have a longstanding relationship. But since Oct. 7, when Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza in response to Hamas-led attacks, Norway has also sharply condemned Israel’s conduct of the war. Norway’s foreign minister said in March that “Israel’s use of military force is having a disproportionately severe impact on the civilian population and is not in line with international humanitarian law,” and called for a cease-fire. Norway also continued to fund UNRWA, the main U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees, after several other countries stopped doing so following Israel’s allegations that about a dozen of the agency’s employees had been involved in the Oct. 7 attacks. In February, Norway testified at theInternational Court of Justice, stating that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem were among the biggest obstacles to peace in the region. The Oslo Accords were landmark agreements that included mutual recognition between the government of Israel and the Palestinian leadership, which was able to return to the occupied territories from exile. The accords also established the Palestinian Authority, which was meant to be an interim body exercising limited Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In 2000, continued negotiations toward a permanent peace treaty to establish an independent Palestinian state alongside an Israeli one dissolved into a second Palestinian uprising and an Israeli military clampdown. Jonas Gahr Store, the prime minister of Norway, said on Wednesday that “a recognition of Palestine is support to moderate forces that are on the defensive, in a long and gruesome conflict.” He called the recognition “an investment in the only solution that can give lasting peace in the Middle East,” and he urged other countries to follow suit “so that the process towards a two-state solution finally can begin again.” Emma Bubolais a Times reporter based in London, covering news across Europe and around the world.More about Emma Bubola Advertisement",The New York Times

ByMegan Specia When the Irish government on Wednesday announced formal recognition of an independent Palestinian state, it drew on its own struggle for statehood and the violence that surrounded it. “From our own history we know what it means: recognition is an act of powerful political and symbolic value,” Simon Harris, the taoiseach, or prime minister of Ireland, said at a news briefing. Mr. Harris was nodding to the Republic of Ireland’s quest for self-rule in the early part of the 20th century after hundreds of years of British rule. He detailed how, on Jan. 21, 1919, Ireland asked the world to recognize its right to independence. “Our message to the free nations of the world was a plea for international recognition of our independence, emphasizing our distinct national identity, our historical struggle and our right to self-determination and justice,” he said. “Today we use the same language to support the recognition of Palestine as a state.” Ireland condemned Hamas after the group led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that officials there say killed some 1,200 people. And since the start of the conflict in Gaza, it has sharply rebuked Israel for its assault that Gazan authorities say has left more than 35,000 people dead. Mr. Harris emphasized that Ireland’s announcement, which came on the same day as similar moves bySpain and Norway, did not diminish his country’s relationship with Israel. Instead, he said, it was an acknowledgment that Israel and a state of Palestine had an equal right to exist. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

What Does It Mean to Recognize a Palestinian State?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/middleeast/palestinian-state.html,2024-05-22T16:07:19+0000,"The move by three European countries fits into a long-term goal of Palestinian leaders to secure diplomatic acceptance, but the immediate impact may be limited.","The decision by three European countries — Ireland, Norway and Spain — to recognize a Palestinian state fits into a long-term goal of Palestinian leaders to secure diplomatic acceptance, but it appears that the immediate practical impact will be limited.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement The move by three European countries fits into a long-term goal of Palestinian leaders to secure diplomatic acceptance, but the immediate impact may be limited. ByMatthew Mpoke Bigg The decision by three European countries — Ireland, Norway and Spain — to recognize a Palestinian state fits into a long-term goal of Palestinian leaders to secure diplomatic acceptance, but it appears that the immediate practical impact will be limited. Broadly speaking, recognizing a state means declaring that it meets the conditions of statehood under international law. It typically opens a path to setting up diplomatic relations and an embassy there. But the European countries appeared to be mostly concerned with expressing support for Palestinians and sending a message to Israel at a time of deepening international concern about its conduct of the war. The foreign minister of Norway, Espen Barth Eide, told a news conference that the country’s representative office to the Palestinian Authority, which was opened in the West Bank in 1999, would become an embassy. He gave no date for this change but said it would enable Norway to enter into bilateral agreements. Recognition would also have some “domestic legal effects in Norway in areas where issues related to the state of Palestine arise,” he said. Statements by the leaders of Ireland and Spain focused on the need for peace in Gaza and the importance of a two-state solution, but did not mention embassies or other immediate changes. “Recognition of Palestine is not the end of a process, it is the beginning,”said Simon Harris, the taoiseach, or prime minister, of Ireland. He said that Ireland was recognizing the right of a Palestinian state to exist in peace and security within internationally agreed borders, and said that to do so sent a message “that there is a viable alternative to the nihilism of Hamas.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But it reflects a growing, global exasperation with Israel that might eventually lend momentum to a two-state solution. ByRoger Cohen Reporting from Paris The decision bySpain, Norway and Irelandto recognize an independent Palestinian state reflects growing exasperation with the Israel of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even from traditional friends, and suggests that international pressure on him will grow. It does not, however, make it inevitable that otherlarger European stateswill follow suit. This year President Emmanuel Macron of France has said such recognition is “not a taboo,” a position reiterated by the French Foreign Ministry on Wednesday. In February, David Cameron, Britain’s foreign secretary, said that such recognition “can’t come at the start of the process, but it doesn’t have to be the very end of the process.” Those were small steps, although beyond anything they have said previously, but far short of recognition of a Palestinian state itself. If Europe were unified, with the major states joining in recognition, leaving the United States isolated in rejecting such a step, then it could have a greater impact, but that stage is far from being reached. “This decision must be useful, that is to say allow a decisive step forward on the political level,” Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné said in a statement about potential recognition. “France does not consider that the conditions have been met to date for this decision to have a real impact on this process.” France, in other words, will wait. So, too, will Germany, whose support for Israel, rooted in atonement for the Holocaust, is second only to that of the United States. The decision of Spain, Norway and Ireland has made one thing clear: There will be no European unity, or at least aligned timing, on the question of recognition of a Palestinian state before such a state exists on the ground.

Sherman of the Orange County Superior Court, came as tens of thousands of U.C. students were preparing for finals at the end of the spring quarter. The judge’s order came in response to the third attempt by the public university system to force thousands of unionized teaching assistants, tutors, researchers and other key workers back to work. Workers represented by United Auto Workers Local 4811walked off the job May 20 at U.C. Santa Cruzand thenextended the rolling striketo campusesat Davis, Los Angeles, Irvine, San Diego and Santa Barbara. The union represents about 48,000 graduate students and other academic workers across the U.C. system, which encompasses 10 universities and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The academic workers have contended, among various charges, that the University of California’s response to demonstrations over the Israel-Hamas war has amounted to a unilateral change in free speech policies and has created an unsafe work environment. The university system has said that the strike is not about working conditions, but rather an attempt to force U.C. institutions to take a position on a political issue. University leaders have twice asked the state Public Employment Relations Board, which normally oversees public sector labor issues, to declare the union’s action unlawful. The board found both times that the university’s claims did not meet the legal threshold required to block the strike. The university asked for injunctive relief on Tuesday and sued the union for breach of contract, charging that the workers had violated no-strike clauses in their collective bargaining agreements. In a separate filing, the state labor board noted that it was already examining that issue and questioned whether the Orange County Superior Court — whose jurisdiction includes Irvine, the site of one of the walkouts — was the appropriate forum for the university to seek relief.

ByAnemona Hartocollis The University of Pennsylvania issued temporary rules on Thursday that significantly rein in protests on campus and, for the first time, explicitly ban encampments. The action came less than a month afterthe police cleared away a pro-Palestinian encampmentat the university and arrested 33 people. Scores of encampments protesting Israel’s war in Gazahave sprung up at universitiesacross the country this spring, leading to more than 3,000 arrests since mid-April and heightened tensions between students and universities. “To ensure the safety of the Penn community and to protect the health and property of individuals, encampments and overnight demonstrations are not permitted in any university location, regardless of space (indoor or outdoor),” Penn’s new rules for protests say, adding, “Unauthorized overnight activities will be considered trespassing and addressed.” The rules also forbid protests that prevent speakers on campus from expressing their views or “other members of the community from hearing or seeing the speaker.” And they bar students from projecting slogans onto buildings or writing slogans on them in semi-permanent or permanent chalk or marker. Penn’s administration said that the new rules, which will be reviewed by a faculty-led task force in the 2024-25 academic year, were issued in response to calls for more clarity about what was permitted on campus. The administration said that the rules “aim to enable free expression while allowing Penn to deliver its core missions of teaching, research, service and patient care without disruption.” The university said that students who violated the rules would face disciplinary action, but did not go into details.

Students Want Charges Dropped. What Is the Right Price for Protests?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/us/college-protests-charges-students.html,2024-06-04T17:46:32+0000,"At pro-Palestinian demonstrations, students have broken codes of conduct and, sometimes, the law. But the question of whether and how to discipline them is vexing universities.",Youssef Hasweh expected to receive his diploma from the University of Chicago on Saturday.,"Advertisement Supported by At pro-Palestinian demonstrations, students have broken codes of conduct and, sometimes, the law. But the question of whether and how to discipline them is vexing universities. ByJeremy W. Peters Youssef Hasweh expected to receive his diploma from the University of Chicago on Saturday. What he got instead was an email from the associate dean of students informing him that, because he was under investigation for his participation in a protest encampment on the campus quad, “your degree will not be conferred until the resolution of this matter.” Like scores of other student demonstrators across the country, Mr. Hasweh has been swept up into a kind of disciplinary limbo. Although he was allowed to participate in graduation, his university is withholding his degree until it determines whether and how to punish him for breaking its code of conduct for refusing to vacate an encampment, which the police cleared on May 7. He has already been formally reprimanded by the university for being part of a group thatoccupiedan administration building last year in a protest over the Israel-Hamas war. transcript “This is the graduation gown that I may or may not be wearing — if they let me walk. I’m leaving UChicago with a criminal record and maybe not with a degree. My name is Youssef. I’m a Brooklyn native. I’m half Palestinian, half Moroccan, and UChicago was definitely my dream school.” “Oh my God. I got to the University of Chicago. Mom!” “And during my time here my mission was to make it a dream school for other folks. And that sort of led me straight into the admissions office. I became a student visit coordinator. I gave tours. I got to act as a college rep. And that sort of bubble of being an ambassador for UChicago on the global scale popped when I started talking about my identity, and I started talking about being Palestinian and critiquing the university.” [chanting] [unclear] “We’ve been doing actions all year. Blockades, sit-ins, rallies, protests, banner drops, flyers, brochures — everything. We really just wanted a meeting with Paul, the president of the University of Chicago. So we wanted, like, financial records. We wanted transparency. We wanted to know where our money was going. And then we wanted the university to divest from all Israeli entities. And it took having to occupy a building and perform a sit-in. Like, 30 of us went into Rosenwald, which is the admissions office, and we just sort of set up camp.” [chanting] [unclear] “I was just thinking to myself, Oh, like, I’m going to be arrested.” [chanting] “You invest in genocide.” “The state attorney had made a statement that she wasn’t going to prosecute protest charges. So as soon as our charges were dropped, the university decided to go through the formal process for us, which means everything is on the table. We could be suspended. We could be expelled.” “We came back to join a national encampment movement.” “We won’t stop until we win.” “We actually were planning an encampment as well, prior to Columbia’s launch. Just seeing solidarity all over the country made us more confident to do this encampment.” “What do you know.” “Where does all our money go.” “Where does our money go.” “I have family in Palestine, and I’m living in Palestine. This is my 24/7. I mean, I’m done. Like, I have nothing left here. And that’s weird, like, coming from me, who spent so many years, not just, like, loving this university, but helping others love it. Like, I’m crushed that the university would ever do this. I feel like I have nothing left at the university here, but people in Palestine truly have nothing.” The question of how harshly to discipline these students cuts deep in academia, where many universities take pride in their history of student activism, on issues such as civil rights, the Vietnam War, South African apartheid and income inequality. Some faculty members themselves celebrate such activism and encourage students to become politically involved — and have also faced arrest and discipline for doing so. But today, some students have made a demand of their colleges that is vexing administrators and veterans of past social movements: They want all charges against them, both academic and legal, dropped. Many students have been charged with criminal misdemeanors, such as trespassing. Others havefaced disciplinefrom their universities, which can range from a warning on their records to suspensions and expulsions. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

From the outskirts of his town in the West Bank, the mayor surveyed the rocky hills stretching toward the Dead Sea where Palestinians had long farmed and herded, and pointed out the new features of the landscape. New guard posts manned by Israeli soldiers. New roads patrolled by Israeli settlers. And, most tellingly, a new metal gate blocking the town’s sole road to those areas, installed and locked by the Israeli army to keep Palestinians out. “Anyone who goes to the gate, they either arrest him or kill him,” said the mayor, Moussa al-Shaer, of the town of Tuqu. On the other side of the gate, atop a bald hill in the distance, stood one of the area’s new residents, Abeer Izraeli, a Jewish settler. “With God’s help, we will stay here a long time,” Mr. Izraeli said. The case of the two people on either side of the gate is a particularly clear example of a dynamic playing out across the Israeli-occupied West Bank. As much of the world has focused on the war in Gaza, Jewish settlers miles away in the West Bank have hastened the rate at which they are seizing land previously used by Palestinians, rights groups say. 10 miles Mediterranean Sea Tel Aviv WEST BANK Jerusalem ISRAEL Tekoa Tuqu GAZA STRIP Dead Sea By The New York Times We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByJesus JiménezandAaron Boxerman President Biden on Fridayoutlined a road mapput forward by Israel that would begin with an immediate, temporary cease-fire and work toward a permanent end to the war and the reconstruction of Gaza. Here are some of the details, as described by Mr. Biden, a senior U.S. administration official who briefed reporters after the president spoke and Israeli officials who have discussed the possible deal. Both sides would observe a six-week cease-fire. Israel would withdraw from major population centers in Gaza, and a number of hostages would be released, including women, the elderly and the wounded. The hostages would be exchanged for the release of hundreds of Palestinian detainees. Aid would begin flowing into Gaza, working up to some 600 trucks a day. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinian civilians would also be allowed to return to their homes in northern Gaza. Most Palestinians fled the north following Israel’s mass evacuation order before the ground invasion began. During the first phase, Israel and Hamas would continue to negotiate to reach a permanent cease-fire. If the talks take more than six weeks, the first phase of the truce will continue until they reach a deal, Mr. Biden said. With a permanent cease-fire, Israel would withdraw completely from Gaza. All the remaining living Israeli hostages would be released, including male soldiers, and more Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange. It was also unclear who would govern the territory under the agreement. Hamas could use a cease-fire to reconstitute its rule in Gaza. In the past, the United States has said that the Palestinian Authority, which has struggled to run the West Bank, ought to be brought in to run Gaza. Israeli officials, including Mr. Netanyahu, have generally rejected either the Palestinian Authority or Hamas running Gaza. Hamas would return the remains of hostages who had died. Rubble would be cleared and a three- to five-year reconstruction period would begin, backed by the United States, Europe and international institutions.

ByAnnie Karni Reporting from Washington The top four congressional leaders formally invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Friday to address a joint meeting of Congress, in a show of bipartisan unity that masked a fraught behind-the-scenes debate over receiving him. The invitation, which set no date, came amid deep political divides in the United States over the war between Israel and Hamas, which has intensified after Israel’s recent attacks in Rafah. Speaker Mike Johnson had been pressing to issue the invitation for weeks, seeking to hug Mr. Netanyahu closer as some Democrats, particularly progressives, repudiate him and condemn his tactics in the war, which have caused tens of thousands of civilian casualties in Gaza and a humanitarian disaster for Palestinians. Republicans have unequivocally backed Mr. Netanyahu’s policies, while Democrats, many of whom view his far-right government as an impediment to peace, have been deeply split over them. On Friday, Mr. Biden called for a permanent cease-fire and said, “It’s time for this war to end.” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, earlier this yearcalled for Mr. Netanyahu to step down and for new elections. In response, Mr. Netanyahuassailed Mr. Schumer in a closed-door virtual speechto Senate Republicans. Mr. Schumer at the time had refused to allow Mr. Netanyahu to make a similar address to Senate Democrats, arguing that it was not helpful to Israel for the prime minister to address American lawmakers in a partisan fashion. Even before the invitation went out on Friday afternoon, the prospect of Mr. Netanyahu’s visit to the Capitol had divided Democrats. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he would boycott a speech from the prime minister, and House progressives said they would plan some sort of gesture to register their opposition to Mr. Netanyahu’s government and to his presence at the Capitol.

On either side of the text were two images of a barefoot boy with tattered clothes and spiky hair, his back turned to us. The character is called Handala (variously transliterated as Hanzala or Handzala), a name derived from a native plant that is deep-rooted, persistent and bears bitter fruit, and has become a potent symbol of the Palestinian struggle. The image was created by thePalestinian political cartoonist Naji Al-Aliin 1969, one of the most widely read cartoonists in the Arab world,who was murdered in London in 1987. (The case remains unsolved.) Handala is 10 years old, the same age that Ali was when he became a refugee in 1948. After the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, also known as the Yom Kippur War, Ali exclusively depicted Handala with his back turned, a gesture that transformed him into a silent witness of the horrors and outrages going on around him. The stance, according to the cartoonist, represented a rejection of the political machinations of foreign nations when it came to the fate of ordinary Palestinians. Margaret Olin, a religious studies scholar at the Yale Divinity School and co-author of “The Bitter Landscapes of Palestine,” has been photographing Handala’s appearance in murals and as graffiti during her visits to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank over the past decade. “It’s become a symbol of the whole Palestinian movement to return to their former homes,” she said in a telephone interview.

ByHamed Aleaziz Reporting from Washington Ghada Redwan, a 48-year-old pharmacist in Houston, has been trying to get her parents out of Gaza for months. Their bags, packed and ready to go, have been sitting by their door in Rafah, the city where Israel is nowconducting a military offensive. But Ms. Redwan has hit roadblocks at every turn. And like other Palestinian Americans desperate to get their relatives to safety, she has described a confounding bureaucratic maze involving the State Department, the governments of Israel and Egypt, politicians, advocacy groups, lawyers and more. The closure this month of the Rafah border crossing into Egypt — the only way out for civilians — has thrown an already complicated system into disarray, leading to calls for the United States to make a more forceful effort to evacuate the relatives of American citizens. “You feel like there’s nothing you can do,” Ms. Redwan said in an interview. “You live comfortably, you have money, you’re a U.S. citizen and your parents are suffering and there’s nothing you can do for them. It is just insane.” Ms. Redwan last spoke to her mother on Monday morning, one day after an Israeli strike thatkilled dozens of Palestiniansin a camp for displaced people in Rafah. “There is no safe place,” her mother told her. “Just pray for us.” Since the start of the war seven months ago, more than 1,800 American citizens and their families have left Gaza with the assistance of the State Department, U.S. officials say.

Soccer’s Governing Body Delays Vote on Palestinian Call to Bar Israel,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/world/middleeast/fifa-israel-soccer-gaza.html,2024-05-17T09:24:18+0000,FIFA said it would solicit legal advice before taking up a motion from the Palestinian Football Association to suspend Israel over its actions in Gaza and the West Bank.,"FIFA, soccer’s global governing body, on Friday postponed a decision to temporarily suspend Israel over its actions during the conflict in Gaza, and in the West Bank, saying it needed to solicit legal advice before taking up a motion submitted by the Palestinian Football Association.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by FIFA said it would solicit legal advice before taking up a motion from the Palestinian Football Association to suspend Israel over its actions in Gaza and the West Bank. ByTariq Panja reporting from Bangkok FIFA, soccer’s global governing body, on Friday postponed a decision to temporarily suspend Israel over its actions during the conflict in Gaza, and in the West Bank, saying it needed to solicit legal advice before taking up a motion submitted by the Palestinian Football Association. The motion calling for Israel’s suspension referred to “international law violations committed by the Israeli occupation in Palestine, particularly in Gaza,” and cited violations of FIFA’s human rights and discrimination statutes. Responding toemotionally charged addressesat FIFA’s annual congress by the head of the Palestinian soccer body, Jibril Rajoub, FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, said the urgency of the situation meant he would convene an extraordinary meeting of FIFA’s top board on July 25. Before that meeting, he said, FIFA will ask experts to analyze whether Israel’s actions breach the governing body’s regulations. By contrast, in 2022, FIFA acted quicklyto bar Russian teams and clubsfrom competitions after the country’s forces launched a full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Mr. Rajoub has for years pursued sanctions against Israel and its teams over a variety of issues, including freedom of movement for Palestinian players and for allowing teams based in territory overseen by the Palestinian soccer federation to play in Israel’s domestic leagues. Since Israeli forces invaded Gaza last October in retaliation for the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, all soccer infrastructure in the territory, including a historic stadium, has been destroyed, Mr. Rajoub said. Israel’s soccer chief, Moshe Zuares, called the Palestinian motion “cynical.” But the possibility of even a temporary ban on its teams could have immediate consequences: Israel is set to compete in the men’s tournament at the Paris Olympics around the time of the FIFA meeting in July, and to begin qualifying for the 2026 men’s World Cup later this year. Both Israeli and Palestinian officials had used the run-up to Friday’s congress to lobby officials from other national federations. A day earlier, at a meeting of Asian soccer’s governing body, memberswere shown a videoshowing the effects of the war in Gaza and then unanimously approved a decision to back the Palestinian federation’s motion. Palestinian officials addressed FIFA’s 211 members twice during Friday’s meeting, and were followed by an official from Jordan who demanded action from FIFA. While acknowledging the urgency of the matter, Mr. Infantino declined to call a vote. Instead, he said, the organization’s 37-member governing council would decide what to do in two months. “FIFA will mandate as of now an independent legal expertise to assess the three requests made by the Palestinian Football Association and make sure that the status and regulations of FIFA are applied in the correct way,” he said.

A pro-Palestinian protest on Columbia University’s campus this spring.Credit...Mark Peterson/Redux Supported by ByEmily BazelonandCharles Homans Emily Bazelon is a staff writer for the magazine who also teaches at Yale Law School. Charles Homans covers politics for The Times. He visited the Columbia campus repeatedly during the demonstrations, counter-demonstrations and police actions in April. Early on the afternoon of Nov. 10, Jameel Jaffer, the director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, was on his way into a meeting in Low Library, the domed neoclassical building at the center of campus, when an administrator pulled him aside. The school, the administrator said, was about to announce the suspensions of the campus chapters of the organizations Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, an allied anti-Zionist organization — a move that alarmed Jaffer given the fraught politics of the moment. The day after Hamas’s brazen Oct. 7 attack on military and civilian targets in Israel, the S.J.P. and J.V.P. chapters co-signed an open letter declaring “full solidarity with Palestinian resistance.” The letter described the attacks as “an unprecedented historic moment for the Palestinians of Gaza” and a “counteroffensive against their settler-colonial oppressor.” It would be tantamount to “asking for quiet submission to systemic violence” for anyone to call for peace now, after years of Israeli violence and military campaigns against Palestinians. The groups issued a list of demands to the university — divestment from companies doing business with the Israeli government, the end of Columbia’s affiliation with Tel Aviv University and a recognition of Palestinian “existence and humanity” — and announced a demonstration on Oct. 12 on the steps of Low Library. They signed off: “See you Thursday.” The Oct. 12 demonstration appeared to be in violation of campus rules, which required student groups to give 10 days’ notice for gatherings in public spaces, but Columbia had not been enforcing such requirements amid the emotional responses to the Hamas attacks and Israel’s retaliatory bombing in the Gaza Strip. “We got some pushback from the university,” recalled Cameron Jones, an organizer of the J.V.P. chapter, “but not insane pushback.” As the sit-ins, teach-ins and die-ins continued, however, that began to change. Pro-Israel groups held counterdemonstrations, and tensions built on Columbia’s small, enclosed central campus. “In the past, demonstrations were basically students protesting against the establishment, and that was, you know, unidirectional and fairly straightforward,” the president of Columbia, Minouche Shafik, said in late May, in her first interview since December. “In this crisis,” she went on, “students are opposed to other students, faculty opposed to other faculty. And those internal dynamics and tensions have made this much more difficult than past episodes.” Outside Columbia’s library, several Israeli students were physically attacked after they confronted another student tearing down posters of Israelis held hostage by Hamas. Students wearing hijabs and kaffiyehs reported being called “Jew killers” and terrorists. By Oct. 25, when S.J.P. and J.V.P. staged a walkout of college classes, “our relationship with the administration was really crumbling,” Jones recalled. Two days later, Israel’s invasion of Gaza began. On the night of Nov. 8, with another demonstration planned for the next day on the steps outside Low, a faculty adviser told the organizers that they were out of compliance with school rules and asked them to postpone the event. Theydid not, and the university suspended them. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

ByMatthew Mpoke Bigg With Israel’s most sacrosanct day of remembrance as a backdrop, peace activists in Israel broadcast their annual Joint Israeli-Palestinian Memorial Day Ceremony on Sunday night, with parallel events in London, New York and Los Angeles. The ceremony, organized by Combatants for Peace and the Parents Circle — Families Forum, two peace-building organizations, is unusual in that it tries to recognize not only Israeli grief, but also the toll of Palestinian suffering over the decades. This year’s event was especially poignant given that it was the first since the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7 and comes amid the devastation caused by the war in Gaza. This year the ceremony, which has been held annually since 2006, was prerecorded to avoid the possibility of disruption by protesters. In previous years it attracted sharp criticism and a legal challenge in Israel, and on Sunday organizers said just before the ceremony was set to be broadcast that its website had been hacked. As a result, the organizers said it was not possible to watch it on YouTube as planned, and viewers instead watched on Facebook. The ceremony, an annual focus for peace activists in Israel, featured speeches, songs, a poem about peace and a video that showed children in Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank talking about the effect of war. One child wished “for everyone who died to come back to life.” Palestinians in the West Bank did not participate in person, given that Israel stopped allowing many Palestinians to work in Israel after the Oct. 7 attacks led by Hamas, which the Israeli authorities say killed around 1,200 people. There were also no direct contributions by speakers in Gaza. “For many Israelis it seems provocative,” Yuval Rahamim said of the ceremony in an interview by telephone from Tel Aviv. Mr. Rahamim, co-director of the Parents Circle — Families Forum, an Israeli-Palestinian organization of families who have lost immediate relatives in the conflict, said that his father had been killed in the 1967 Arab–Israeli War. He acknowledged that many Israelis would find the event jarring, given the scale of suffering on Oct. 7, but he said that also gave it more significance. “Many people have woken up to the reality that this conflict cannot go on,” he said, referring to the decades of violence. “People are willing to stand up.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

She said hospital officials then fired her because she made pro-Palestinian remarks in an acceptance speech. ByJoseph Goldstein Earlier this month, NYU Langone Health bestowed an award on a labor and delivery nurse for providing compassionate care to mothers who had lost babies. But shortly after, the nurse said, the hospital fired her over the speech she gave when she accepted the award. In it, she spoke of the suffering of Palestinian women amid the Israel-Hamas war, which she called a “genocide.” The nurse, Hesen Jabr, is not the first medical worker to be fired at NYU Langone, a major New York hospital system, over commentary about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The hospitalis currently embroiled in a lawsuitby a prominent cancer researcher, whowas fired from his jobas the director of its cancer center after he posted a variety of anti-Hamas political cartoons. Some included offensive caricatures of Arab people. A young doctor-trainee was also “removed from service” at an NYU Langone hospital on Long Island, according to the hospital, after being accused of posting a message on Instagram defending the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel — though he was later quietly reinstated. In her speech, accordingto a video she posted on social media, Ms. Jabr drew a connection between her work with grieving mothers in New York and the war in Gaza. “It pains me to see the women from my country going through unimaginable losses themselves during the current genocide in Gaza,” said Ms. Jabr, who is Palestinian-American. “This award is deeply personal to me for those reasons.” She added, “Even though I can’t hold their hands and comfort them as they grieve their unborn children and the children they have lost during this genocide, I hope to keep making them proud as I keep representing them here at NYU.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Officials were criticized for their handling of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. ByVimal PatelandAnemona Hartocollis Harvard said on Tuesday that it would now avoid taking positions on matters that are not “relevant to the core function of the university,” accepting the recommendations of a faculty committee that urged the university to dramatically reduce its messages on issues of the day. If put into practice, Harvard would no longer issue official statements of empathy, which it did for Ukraine, after the Russian invasion, and for the victims of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel, for example. “In issuing official statements of empathy, the university runs the risk of appearing to care more about some places and events than others,” the report said. “And because few, if any, world events can be entirely isolated from conflicting viewpoints, issuing official empathy statements runs the risk of alienating some members of the community by expressing implicit solidarity with others.” The university’s Institutional Voice Working Group, made up of eight faculty members, issued the report, with a set of principles and a recommended path forward, which the administration and governing board accepted. “Harvard isn’t a government,” Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor and a co-chair of the committee that developed the recommendations, said inan interview with The Harvard Gazette, released Tuesday as part of the university’s announcement. “It shouldn’t have a foreign policy or a domestic policy.” The report, however, did not fully embrace “institutional neutrality” — a principle promoted by the University of Chicago, in which universities commit to staying out of political and social matters. Some universities, including Stanford University and Northwestern, announced shortly after the Hamas attack that they would adopt the policy. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

At Barnard College, Mariame Sissoko, the student government president, began to question the value of always following the rules.Credit...Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Supported by ByEmma Goldberg Emma Goldberg spent the weeks leading up to graduation interviewing more than a dozen students across Columbia’s and Barnard’s campuses and attending their graduations. Standing on the stage at Radio City Music Hall, Mariame Sissoko began to speak in a voice trembling, ever so slightly. Growing up in Philadelphia, Sissoko was outspoken, a high achiever, captain of the high school debate team. In other words, just the sort of person who would go to Barnard College, run for student government and wind up giving a graduation speech before an audience of 4,700 university officials, classmates and parents. Sissoko, 22, who uses nonbinary pronouns, had been warned by administrators not to deviate from the speech they had turned in weeks earlier. But that speech was written before a pro-Palestinian encampment sprang up on the main lawn of Columbia (Barnard’s sibling school), before students occupied an academic building, Hamilton Hall, and the police made more than100arrests, before the campus became a locus of anger over the more than 35,000people killedin Gaza during the war and of fear over risingantisemitism. Now, on graduation day, Sissoko put those warnings from administrators aside. “To stand on this stage today is a privilege,” Sissoko said. “It is a privilege that over 15,000 children in Gaza will never receive.” Sissoko’s classmates broke into applause. On Sissoko’s lapel was a poppy, meant to honor a 6-year-old Palestinian girl killed during the war and a 10-month-old Israeli baby taken hostage by Hamas. “I know that there are countless poppies with the names of children in Gaza who have been killed,” Sissoko continued. “They will walk across this stage with us.” As Sissoko paused, classmates seated in the audience began to sing an anthem that was popularized during the civil rights movement and that pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia had now taken up: “We shall not, we shall not be moved.” From the rows of family seating came cries of “Boo!,” a chorus that grew louder as the students kept singing. An automated voice came over the loudspeaker: “Today’s speaker shared personal views, which may not reflect the views and values of Barnard College.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

It is not against any state, but it is against the attempts to deprive us of our state. That is why the Israeli government is so opposed to it. Because they oppose our independence and the two-state solution altogether.” “This is your mirror. So that you can see exactly what you are inflicting upon the U.N. charter with this destructive vote. This is — You are shredding the U.N. Charter with your own hands.” “The result of the vote is as follows: in favor 143, against nine, abstentions 25. Draft resolution A/ES10/L30/Rev1 is adopted.” [cheering] ByFarnaz Fassihi The United Nations General Assembly on Friday overwhelmingly adopted a resolution declaring that Palestinians qualify for full-members status at the United Nations, a highly symbolic move that reflects growing global solidarity with Palestinians and is a rebuke to Israel and the United States. The resolution was approved by a vote of 143 to 9 with 25 nations abstaining. The Assembly broke into a big applause after the vote. But the resolution does not mean a Palestinian state will be recognized and admitted to the United Nations as a full member anytime soon. The Assembly can only grant full membership with the approval of the Security Council, and, if history is a guide, the United States would almost inevitably wield its veto power to kill such a measure, as it did in April. Even though a majority in the General Assembly have long supported Palestinian statehood, the resolution was the first time the body had voted on the issue of full membership. The resolution declares that “the State of Palestine is qualified for membership in the United Nations” under its charter rules and recommends that the Security Council reconsider the matter with a favorable outcome. The resolution was prepared by the United Arab Emirates, the current chair of the U.N. Arab Group, and sponsored by 70 countries. The United States voted no, along with Hungary, Argentina, Papua New Guinea, Micronesia and Nauru. “The vast majority of countries in this hall are fully aware of the legitimacy of the Palestinian bid and the justness of their cause, which faces fierce attempts to suppress it and render it meaningless today,” said the U.A.E. ambassador, Mohamed Abushahab, as he introduced the resolution on behalf of the Arab Group.

","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Under a U.S.-brokered agreement, Egypt allowed trucks to pass through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom. ByAaron BoxermanandVivek Shankar Aid trucks from Egypt entered the Gaza Strip on Sunday under a new U.S.-brokered agreement to reopen a vital conduit for humanitarian relief, the Israeli military and the Egyptian Red Crescent said. Egypt had blocked aid from entering the enclave via its territory since Israel’s seizure of the Rafah crossing — which provides access to southern Gaza — in early May. The two sides have traded blame over that crossing’s closure, even as aid has piled up on the Egyptian side. After U.S. pressure, Egypt announced on Friday that it had agreed to divert trucks through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, which is roughly two miles from the Rafah crossing, as a temporary measure. Some 126 trucks from Egypt containing food, fuel and other necessities entered the Gaza Strip through Kerem Shalom on Sunday, the Israeli military said in a statement. The trucks were inspected by Israeli officials, said Ahmad Ezzat, an Egyptian Red Crescent official.  The quantity of food, water and medicines reaching Gazans has plummeted since the war began nearly eight months ago. As a result, the United Nations and aid groups have been warning of widespread hunger in the enclave and urging Israel to open more routes for aid to enter. But in recent weeks, aid shipments into Gaza throughthe two main land conduitshave been interrupted. One of those crossings is Kerem Shalom, which sits at the intersection of Gaza, Israel and Egypt. Israel temporarily closed Kerem Shalom a few weeks ago after a Hamas rocket attack there killed four of its soldiers. Since then Israel has allowedsome aid into Gaza through Kerem Shalom, but its distribution has been a point of contention. Israel says that aid agencies must distribute the aid. But the agencies say that the Israeli military’s activity in southern Gaza has made their job nearly impossible. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByErica L. Green Reporting from Washington A White House spokesman on Friday defended the United States’ decision to opposea U.N. resolution declaring support for Palestinian statehood, saying that such a measure should be negotiated in the Middle East. The United States was among a handful of holdouts as the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution declaring that Palestinians qualify for full membership at the United Nations. The vote was widely seen as a rebuke of Israel and the United States as global outrage mounts over the Israel-Hamas war. John F. Kirby, a White House national security spokesman, said President Biden remained “fully and firmly committed” to a Palestinian state, but the U.N. resolution was not the way to establish it. “We continue to believe in the power and promise of a two-state solution, and an independent state for the Palestinian people,” Mr. Kirby told reporters. “We also believe that the best way to do that is through direct negotiations with the parties and not through a vote of the U.N. of this kind.” Friday’s vote comes as the ties between the United States and Israel, its closest ally in the Middle East, are tested over the war in Gaza. More than 34,000 people have died in Gaza, including both combatants and civilians, and the director of the World Food Program has said that parts of the Gaza Strip are experiencing a “full-blown famine.” The United States is thebiggest supplier of weaponsto Israel, and Mr. Biden is hoping to use that leverage to get Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to forgo a long-threatened invasion of Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than one million Palestinians have taken refuge.

BySarah Kessler,Lauren HirschandMichael J. de la Merced Tim Cook has delivered at least seven commencement addresses since becoming the chief executive of Apple. The superstar Taylor Swift, whose concerts have been credited with lifting local economies, addressed New York University’s graduation ceremony in 2022. Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Jamie Dimon — they’ve all given graduation speeches more than once. They’re obviously not doing it for the money (and typically there isn’t any). Instead, speakers have long seen graduation ceremonies as offering something increasingly rare: a stage where a large group of people gather to hear speakers impart wisdom, advice or whatever else they want to talk about. The appeal of being a commencement speaker, however, seems to be waning. Just three Fortune 50 chief executives appear to be commencement speakers this year, as colleges have faced campus protests over the war in Gaza, student arrests and wealthy alumni threatening to break ties with their alma maters over antisemitism. “The idea of C.E.O.s going out aggressively and speaking anywhere near this environment on campuses, it just doesn’t seem like the moment for them to be doing that,” said David Murray, the executive director of the Professional Speechwriters Association. C.E.O.s are tired of talking.At a recent meeting of executive speechwriters, Murray said one takeaway stood out. As one presenter put it,“Less is more, in ’24.” Murray highlighted the sentiment in the Professional Speechwriters Association’s May newsletter: “Folks will increasingly keep their leaders out of the spotlight,” he wrote, describing the current moment as one in which “even formerly anodyne messages encouraging employees to vote” sound partisan to some.

Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania said on Thursday that it was “past time” for Penn’s administration to clear the encampment. ByMattathias Schwartz Reporting from Philadelphia A pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of Pennsylvania has expanded, as students wrap up exams and the university finalizes its plans for graduation ceremonies on May 20. A post onsocial mediaby an account associated with the Penn encampment said the expansion on Wednesday night was in response to “the administration’s continued bad-faith negotiations” over demands that the university divest from financial support for Israel. Steve Silverman, a spokesman for Penn, declined to comment on the activists’ assertion that the university was not negotiating in good faith. For nearly two weeks, the protesters have been occupying the west side of a green space in front of College Hall, the oldest building on campus. On Wednesday night, after a march that brought a large group of students and Philadelphia activists to College Hall, protesters expanded the encampment to the east side of the green space, moving the metal barriers that had been erected to mark the boundaries of the protest space. Penn’s administration has largely taken a hands-off approach to the encampment. But on Thursday afternoon, the university announced actions against six students in connection with the “unauthorized encampment.” In astatement posted on Penn’s website, the university said it had imposed “mandatory temporary leaves of absence” on the students pending “disciplinary investigations.” When asked on Thursday about the protests, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania said that it was “past time” for Penn’s administration to clear the encampment. “Over the last 24 hours at the University of Pennsylvania, the situation has gotten even more unstable and out of control,” he said,speaking at an unrelated news conferencenear Pittsburgh. The governor, who is a nonvoting member of Penn’s board of trustees, demurred when asked whether he would take independent action, saying that the matter was best left to campus administrators and local police. On Thursday, the scene around the encampment was subdued. Some protesters rested on a plinth beneath a statue of Benjamin Franklin. Others walked around the encampment with the chief of Penn’s fire and emergency services, who was surveying the grounds for potential hazards. Outside the barriers were small groups of police officers, college administrators and pro-Israel counterprotesters. This week,Penn announcedspecial security measures for commencement, including no bags and “airport-style security screening.” Advertisement",The New York Times

Palestinians were stuck between an Israeli blockade and a repressive security force. ByAdam RasgonandRonen Bergman Adam Rasgon reported from Jerusalem, and Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv. The Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has for years overseen a secret police force in Gaza that conducted surveillance on everyday Palestinians and built files on young people, journalists and those who questioned the government, according to intelligence officials and a trove of internal documents reviewed by The New York Times. The unit, known as the General Security Service, relied on a network of Gaza informants, some of whom reported their own neighbors to the police. People landed in security files for attending protests or publicly criticizing Hamas. In some cases, the records suggest that the authorities followed people to determine if they were carrying on romantic relationships outside marriage. Hamas has long run an oppressive system of governance in Gaza, and many Palestinians there know that security officials watch them closely. But a 62-slide presentation on the activities of the General Security Service, delivered only weeks before the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, reveals the degree to which the largely unknown unit penetrated the lives of Palestinians. The documents show that Hamas leaders, despite claiming to represent the people of Gaza, would not tolerate even a whiff of dissent. Security officials trailed journalists and people they suspected of immoral behavior. Agents got criticism removed from social media and discussed ways to defame political adversaries. Political protests were viewed as threats to be undermined. Everyday Gazans were stuck — behind the wall of Israel’s crippling blockade and under the thumb and constant watch of a security force. That dilemma continues today, with the added threat of Israeli ground troops and airstrikes. “We’re facing bombardment by the occupation and thuggery by the local authorities,” Ehab Fasfous, a journalist in the Gaza Strip who appeared in the files of the General Security Service, said in a phone interview from Gaza.

ByJeremy W. Peters Around now, university officials might usually take a deep breath. Campuses are emptying out for the end of the academic year. Gone, for the most part, are the tent cities that student activists erected as a symbol of opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza. But this summer might feel longer than most. Congressional Republicans have promised to press their investigation into college antisemitism, even as they have completed their latest hearing, which they tried to turn into a public shaming session for the leaders of Rutgers, Northwestern and the University of California, Los Angeles, over their handling of campus encampments. And protesters have likewise promised not to give up — with hundreds walking out at Harvard’s graduation on Thursday, and students at U.C.L.A. pitching new tents and briefly taking over a building. Over the next few months, colleges will need to navigate a complex set of challenges. There are ongoing federal investigations at scores of universities and school districts over their handling of antisemitism claims. There are hundreds of discipline cases to be decided. And plans are needed for the fall, when college quads will fill back up just a couple of months before the presidential election — possibly with more protesters. Here is what may keep university presidents up at night. One of the major takeaways from the hearing on Thursday was that the three universities had yet to resolve scores of disciplinary cases involving student protesters. The chancellor of U.C.L.A., Gene Block, said on Thursday that the school was conducting more than 100 investigations into student conduct involving both antisemitism and Islamophobia.

ByVivian Yee,Bilal ShbairandMatthew Mpoke Bigg For weeks, the Gaza Strip’s southernmost city, Rafah, was one of the few places where desperate Gazans could find some aid and food. Bakeries sold bread; fuel powered generators; markets were open, if expensive. But since Israeli forces began an incursion in the city this month — effectively closing the two main crossings where aid enters — Rafah has become a place of fear and dwindling supplies. Bakeries have shuttered. So have malnutrition treatment centers. The price of the firewood that many people now use to cook has doubled. Tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers have grown so expensive that they are sold by the piece, not by the kilogram. Families hide what canned goods they still have. They eye their emptying sacks of flour, calculating how long they will last. “There’s always something missing in the tent,” said Ahmed Abu al-Kas, 51, who is sheltering in Rafah with his family. “If we have bread, we don’t have water. If we have firewood, we don’t have some basic vegetables.” For months, international aid officials and health experts have warned that famine will come for Gaza unless Israel lifts barriers keeping most humanitarian aid out, the fighting stops and vital services such as health care and clean water, which must be in place to fend off malnutrition, are restored. None of those conditions have been met. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

ByShawn Hubler A union for academic workers in the University of California system announced on Thursday that an ongoing strike challenging the system’s handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations would extend to two more campuses, U.C.L.A. and U.C. Davis, starting next Tuesday. The announcementcame on the same day that U.C.L.A.’s chancellor, Gene D. Block, testified before Congress about his handling of a violent attack on an encampment there last month by counterprotesters. The walkoutfirst started this week at U.C. Santa Cruz, involving about 2,000 teaching assistants, tutors and researchers, and it has threatened to complicate coursework and spring finals for the 20,000 students enrolled there. The Santa Cruz, Davis and Los Angeles campuses all end their spring quarters in mid-June. The union, U.A.W. 4811, part of the United Auto Workers, represents about 48,000 graduate students and other academic workers across the U.C. system, which encompasses 10 campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Among other grievances, the workers have charged that the university’s response to recent campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war has created an unsafe work environment, and has amounted to an unlawful and unilateral change in its policies on free speech. The union has claimed that disciplinary proceedings against students and employees involved in the protests have barred some from campus and others from university housing. Rafael Jaime, the U.A.W. president, said the strike had been authorized through June 30. University of California officials have said that the strike is an unlawful attempt to pressure the system to concede to a political agenda, and officials have filed for an injunction with the state Public Employment Relations Board to immediately end the walkout. The board stopped short of an injunction, butissued a complaint late Thursdayaccusing the union of failing to provide adequate notice of its work stoppage, and failing to meet and confer with the university in good faith. The board called the two sides to an informal hearing on Friday morning. On Capitol Hill, Dr. Block acknowledged to the House committee that he had made mistakes in dealing with the encampment at U.C.L.A. last month, and added that the university had created a new security office reporting to the chancellor. The police response to the counterprotester attack late last month is nowunder investigation, and the campus police chiefwas removed from his postthis week. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators were arrested after the April 30 attack. When grilled by Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, on whether any of the counterprotesters had been apprehended, Dr. Block said on Thursday that the Los Angeles Police Department was working to identify them. Just as the U.C.L.A. chancellor was testifying,a small group of pro-Palestinian protesters formed a new encampment, barricading an area on campus known as the Kerckhoff Patio with umbrellas, tables and slabs of wood. Some protesters who were standing outside of the encampment carried signs that said “U.A.W. rank and file workers for Palestine.” By Thursday afternoon, they appeared to have abandoned the encampment.

The university said that it was not aware of the police making any arrests. transcript Whose university? Our university! Whose university? Our university! ByJonathan Wolfe,Grace WhitakerandNicholas Bogel-Burroughs Jonathan Wolfe and Grace Whitaker reported from Los Angeles, and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs from New York. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators at the University of California, Los Angeles, briefly formed a new encampment and then took over a campus building on Thursday before police officers in riot gear moved in to disband the efforts. The protests, which drew hundreds of people, came on the same day that the U.C.L.A. chancellorwas grilled in a hearing on Capitol Hillover his handling of a similar encampment last month. By the afternoon, about 70 protesters had entered Dodd Hall, an academic building, sealing off doors with computer cables and jackets. One protester, speaking into a megaphone, asked anyone not affiliated with U.C.L.A. to leave and acknowledged the ad hoc nature of the protest: “We’re building this plane as we fly it.” But just a few hours after the protesters had gotten inside, police officers in riot gear barged in and cleared the building — a contrast to what Republicans lawmakers criticized as a slow response to the demonstrations in late April. Protesters had initially set up a small encampment earlier on Thursday in an area known as the Kerckhoff Patio, but quickly abandoned it after officers wearing helmets and carrying batons moved in. The protesters then fled to an area by Murphy Hall, amassing about 300 people at one point, and then some eventually moved into Dodd Hall. In recent weeks, student activists have been calling on the university to divest from companies that they view as enabling Israel’s war in Gaza. Their demonstration in April was one of the most high-profile campus protests this year. More than 200 protesters were arrested after a group of pro-Israel counterprotesters attacked the encampment.

BySharon Otterman When Jonathan Holloway, a scholar of African American history, was appointed as the 21st president of Rutgers in 2020, he said one of his goals was to foster “a beloved community,” a university culture defined by tolerance, diversity and the spirited exchange of opinions and ideas. “If ever there is a time when people need to be authentically listened to, it’s now,” he toldRutgers Magazineshortly after taking office. “So, it’s important to me to be graceful. To grant grace.” His goal has been tested ever since. Even before the war in Gaza brought upheaval to college campuses, Dr. Holloway was under scrutiny for several unpopular moves. Thousands ofinstructors went on strike to demand better pay, leading Dr. Holloway to threaten a court order to force them back to work. He also approved a tuition increase and removed a popular administrator, theChronicle of Higher Educationreported. LastSeptember, in a symbolic move, the Rutgers University Senate voted no confidence in his leadership following the months of tumult. The Rutgers Senate is a democratically elected group of faculty, staff and students; it does not, however, have the power to remove the president. This spring, Dr. Holloway decided to strike adealwith pro-Palestinian demonstrators to end their four-day encampment at the university’s New Brunswick campus. Some charged that he had rewarded demonstrators after they disrupted campus life and chanted anti-Israel slogans that some view as antisemitic. Dr. Holloway has defended the agreement, even though he acknowledged that “some of the statements that I have heard are disgraceful and have no place at a university.” “The result of our actions was a peaceful return to the normal course of business,” he told the school’sBoard of Governorson May 6. Before becoming Rutgers’sfirst Black president, Dr. Holloway was provost of Northwestern University and a professor of history at Yale for nearly two decades. At Yale, he also served as dean of Yale College. President Holloway’s scholarly work focuses on African American history after the civil war, and he has published several books.

That’s why it’s ripe for disruption. ByJason Farago Recycled robes, processional marches, silver pens from Tiffany: It is graduation season in America. May brings a nationwide festival of youth, with roots stretching back to before the foundation of the republic, and though many college commencements this month have taken place under police surveillance amid student outcry, the ceremonies have gone on. There are more than three centuries of precedents for graduation rituals — for its dress, for its speeches, and for its disturbances. If commencement is ripe for contestation (the backs turned on the speaker, the kaffiyeh replacing the pointed sash), that’s because it’s one of the very last venues in which Americans show a commitment tohowwe do things, and not just what we say and record. I am always a little surprised that universities have hung onto these habits, almost uniquely longstanding. This is a country where very little endures. You can arrive at the Met Gala half-naked. You can play Bach or Beyoncé at a funeral. But graduation still has rules. The students graduating from four-year colleges and universities this month began their studies, for the most part, in Pandemic Year Zero. They missed, in 2020, the walk across the football field or the auditorium stage to collect their high school diploma, and as the war in Gaza continues to inflame campuses some are facing disarray again. Columbia University, which called in the New York Police Department to oust pro-Palestinian student demonstrators, broke its universitywide commencement into smaller chunks. Emory University moved its ceremonies off campus. None has been outright canceled, though. It takes a lot to cancel a graduation. At Harvard, wherehundreds of studentswalked out of this year’s main ceremony, outbreaks of smallpox meant no commencement in 1752, 1757 (theSeven Years’ Wardidn’t help that year), and 1764. Revolutionary hostilities canceled the commencements of 1774-78 and 1780, but Harvard would not miss a commencement again until 2020. The ceremony took place through the Civil War and two world wars, and it went ahead in 1970, after National Guardsmen shot and killed four students at Kent State who were protesting the war in Vietnam. (Demonstrations did cancel graduation at Boston University, Hunter College and other schools; Kent State’swas scaled down.) In Harvard Yard that June, graduates protested the war by refusing to don cap and gown, or else by wearing white armbands over their robes. Local demonstrators with a bullhorn occupied the dais to demand low-income housing in Cambridge. Students heard dueling orations that denounced the Nixon administration and Students for a Democratic Society. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

5 Takeaways From the Latest Hearing on Campus Antisemitism,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/college-antisemitism-hearing-protests.html,2024-05-23T09:04:32+0000,"The leaders of Northwestern, Rutgers and the University of California, Los Angeles, appeared to have navigated their testimony before Congress without many significant missteps.","The leaders of three universities denied that their campuses have become “hotbeds of antisemitism,” as one House Republican described them in a congressional hearing on Thursday.

ByJacey Fortin The leaders of three universities denied that their campuses have become “hotbeds of antisemitism,” as one House Republican described them in a congressional hearing on Thursday. But they acknowledged missteps in the handling of the pro-Palestinian demonstrations that have engulfed American universities in recent months, and said that some acts of hostility toward Jewish students need to be addressed. The hearing grew heated at times, especially as Republicans accused the leaders of Northwestern and Rutgers of “giving in” to demonstrators. But for the most part, the presidents of the two schools, as well as the chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles, appeared to fare better than other university leaders who have testified before the same committee since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Although they got caught up in some testy exchanges and seemed to dodge a few questions, the leaders appeared to have navigated their testimony on Thursday without many significant missteps. Their responses were at times considered, and at other times combative. They pointed to the challenges of balancing student safety with free speech — especially at Rutgers and U.C.L.A., which are both public universities that must abide by the First Amendment — and they condemned episodes of antisemitism on campus. Here are five takeaways from the hearing. The presidents of Rutgers and Northwestern said that the goal of striking deals with pro-Palestinian protesters had been to end the encampments and restore safety for all students, including Jewish students who found the demonstrations threatening. Coming to agreements with the demonstrators had made that possible, they said — and noted that they had done it without committing to divesting from Israel, as students had demanded. “We had to get the encampment down,” said Michael Schill, the president of Northwestern University, adding that he had sought to avoid police intervention on campus — a decision that many of his peers have made, leading to nearly 3,000 arrests at universities since April 18.

ByEmma G. Fitzsimmons As tension continues to simmer over the Israel-Hamas war, New York City officials have embraced a privately funded initiative to send all eighth graders in public and charter schools to visit the Museum of Jewish Heritage. The program, part of a $2.5 million public-private partnership to address antisemitism, will be seeded with $1 million from a foundation run by Jon Gray, the president of the investment firm Blackstone. The citywide field trip plan, which was announced on Thursday, will center on the museum’s efforts to educate younger visitors about the Holocaust. The initiative comes as schools grapple with questions about how to approach the Israel-Hamas war and what to teach about the history of the conflict. It will be optional for schools and will start this fall. Inplaces like California, there have beenpushes for teaching pro-Palestinian lessonsin schools. Leaders in New York City’s school system, which is particularly diverse, with tens of thousands of Jewish, Muslim and Arab students, are moving to offernew curriculum materials about antisemitism and Islamophobia. New York is one of nearly two dozen states that are required to teach students about the Holocaust, andlawmakers included $500,000 in the state budgetthis year to review and update Holocaust curriculums in schools.

ByMaya Shwayder,Jenna RussellandAnemona Hartocollis Maya Shwayder reported from Cambridge, Mass. Hundreds of students walked out of Harvard University’s commencement ceremony on Thursday morning as degrees were conferred, while hundreds chanted “Let them walk!”, a reference to 13 student protesters who were not allowed to graduate after a vote Wednesday by the Harvard Corporation, the university’s governing body. The walkout was a jarring reminder of continuing unrest on the Cambridge campus, on a day when more than 9,000 graduates and their families were gathered in Harvard Yard for celebration and reflection. At the start of the ceremony, the university’s interim president, Alan Garber — loudly booed by some in the crowd — acknowledged the turmoil, and the possibility that “some among us may choose to take the liberty of expressing themselves to draw attention to events unfolding in the wider world.” “This moment of joy coincides with moments of fear and dread, grief and anger, suffering and pain,” he said. “Elsewhere, people are experiencing the worst days of their lives.” He asked the crowd to observe a minute of silence. Student speakers at the ceremony strongly criticized the Harvard Corporation for its vote on Wednesday to bar the 13 undergraduate protesters from receiving their degrees in the wake of campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war. The move was seen by the students and their faculty supporters as a violation of an agreement made between administrators and students to clear their encampment from Harvard Yard.

BySharon Otterman,Ernesto LondoñoandNicholas Bogel-Burroughs For the fourth time in six months, the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce is summoning school leaders to Washington to be questioned about accusations of antisemitism at their institutions. This time, on Thursday, the committee’s focus will be on how three diverse universities reacted when pro-Palestinian encampments sprung up on their lawns as part of an international wave of student activism against the war in Gaza. Two of the schools whose leaders will testify — Northwestern and Rutgers — made deals with protesters to end their encampments peacefully. The third, the University of California, Los Angeles, called in the police to dismantle its encampment, but only after a violent attack by counterprotesters the night before caused the situation toveer out of control. Representative Virginia Foxx, the chairwoman of the committee, has blasted Rutgers and Northwestern for negotiating with the demonstrators, whose views she has described as antisemitic and supportive of terrorism. But she has also derided U.C.L.A.’s chancellor for calling the police too late, saying he allowed his campus to become a “severe and pervasive hostile environment for Jewish students.” “The committee has a clear message for mealy-mouthed, spineless college leaders: Congress will not tolerate your dereliction of your duty to your Jewish students,” Ms. Foxx said in aMay 16 statementannouncing the hearing. “No stone must go unturned while buildings are being defaced, campus greens are being captured or graduations are being ruined.” The three college leaders do not dispute that Jewish students have faced antisemitism, both on and off their campuses.

ByJoseph Bernstein Last fall, a Barnard College sophomore named Sophie Fisher reached out to her freshman year roommate to catch up over coffee. Her old friend’s response was tepid, and Ms. Fisher wondered why. The two had been close enough that the roommate had come to the bar mitzvah of Ms. Fisher’s brother. Several months later, the reason became clear. Over Instagram, Ms. Fisher’s roommate wrote to her that they couldn’t be friends anymore because she had been posting in support of Israel since the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7. In other words, she was a Zionist. Ms. Fisher thought she had been careful to avoid inflammatory posts, but the roommate, Ms. Fisher said, accused her of racism. Then she blocked Ms. Fisher. Around the same time, Ms. Fisher noticed something else strange. Her “big” — a mentor in her sorority — had stopped talking to her. When they were in the same room, Ms. Fisher said, the big wouldn’t make eye contact with her. Ms. Fisher said that her big often posted about Students for Justice in Palestine, the campus group that Columbia had suspended in November for violating campus policies. Ms. Fisher remains in the sorority, but the two haven’t spoken in months. “She was supposed to be my big sister,” she said. This spring, college campuses became the main stage for the American protest movement against Israel’s seven-month-old war in Gaza. In April and May, dozens of pro-Palestinian encampments sprang up at universities around the country, as students called for institutional divestment from (and, at times, for the total dismantling of) Israel. The protests have been characterized by heated rhetoric around the term “Zionist,” a word that typically refers to people who believe Jews have a right to a state in their ancestral homeland in present-day Israel (regardless of how they may feel about the war in Gaza). Many Palestinians and those who support them associate the word with mass displacement during the 1948 war triggered by the creation of Israel, as well as the killings over the past months of thousands of civilians and the decimation of Gaza. Throughchants, statementsand sometimesphysical obstruction, many protesters have made clear they don’t want to share space with people they consider Zionists — and indeed, that they find the ideology unacceptable. At the University of California, Los Angeles, pro-Palestinian studentsblocked peers who identified themselves as Zionistsfrom parts of campus. Given that alarge majorityof American Jews say caring about Israel is an important part of their Jewish identity, these instances of exclusion have led to a debate over whether the encampments are de facto antisemitic.

"No Gaza Aid Delivered Through U.S.-Built Pier Has Been Distributed, Pentagon Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-pier-food.html,2024-05-22T00:22:28+0000,"The temporary pier is one of few remaining entry points for aid shipments since Israel began an incursion into Rafah, in southern Gaza, earlier this month.","None of the food and supplies that have entered the Gaza Strip through a U.S.-built temporary pier in its first five days of operation have been distributed to Palestinians by aid organizations, Gen. Patrick S.

ByGaya Gupta None of the food and supplies that have entered the Gaza Strip through a U.S.-built temporary pier in its first five days of operation have been distributed to Palestinians by aid organizations, Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, said at a news briefing on Tuesday. General Ryder said that 569 metric tons of aid had made it onto Gaza’s shore, but that those supplies had yet to be parceled out by humanitarian organizations. On Saturday, hungry crowdslooted several World Food Program truckstransporting aid that had been delivered through the pier, prompting the agency to suspend deliveries of aid arriving at the pier on Sunday and Monday. General Ryder also said that after discussions with Israel and the United Nations, alternative routes for the safe movement of staff and cargo had been established. The aid is now being taken to warehouses for further distribution, he said. “We do anticipate that assistance will be distributed in the coming days, of course, conditions permitting,” he said. The temporary pier is one of few remaining entry points for aid shipments after Israel’s incursion into Rafah, in southern Gaza, earlier this month. Israel not only seized the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt but also closed the Kerem Shalom crossing into Israel. Those were the two main entry points for truck convoys carrying aid overland. Though Israel has since reopened Kerem Shalom, only 69 trucks have entered Gaza through it in the past two weeks, according to U.N. data. That is far fewer than the number of aid trucks that were entering through the two southern border crossings before Israeli troops went into Rafah. That number peaked at 340 trucks a day. The 569 metric tons that have arrived at the pier so far are a fraction of the amount of aid that was entering Gaza through land routes before Israel seized the Rafah crossing. The United Nations estimates that trucks carrying food to Gaza have been loaded with roughly 15 to 30 metric tons each. The pier system, which cost an estimated $300 million, became operational on Thursday, after it was connected to the Mediterranean shore in central Gaza. On Friday, the first trucks of aid beganmoving ashore. So far, however, the operation has fallen short of its goal of bringing in 90 trucks a day and eventually ramping up to 150 trucks. General Ryder said that more aid was on the way but that the U.S. military was taking a “crawl, walk, run” approach, working out the logistical hurdles and taking into account security conditions. “So I think you’re going to see as we work together the amount of aid increase, and the ability to get it distributed increase,” he said.

Gazans Say I.C.C.

ByHiba Yazbek,Ameera HaroudaandIyad Abuheweila Palestinians in Gaza expressed mixed feelings after the chief prosecutor at the world’s top criminal court said he wasseeking arrest warrantsfor leaders of both Israel and Hamas on war crimes charges, a move that many said equated victim with perpetrator. “We deplore, denounce and are surprised by the decision of the International Criminal Court which places the accused, the victim, and the executioner in one cage,” said Zahir Essam, a 55-year-old living in Gaza City. Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, announced on Monday his decision to apply for arrest warrants for Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza; Muhammad Deif, Hamas’s military chief; and Ismail Haniyeh, the movement’s Qatar-based top political official. He also said he would seek warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of Israel. The announcement in effect treated Israeli officials and Hamas leaders in the same way, despite what Mr. Essam sees as a power imbalance between the two sides in the conflict in Gaza, which began when Hamas led an attack on Israel on Oct. 7. That attack killed about 1,200 people, and about 240 others were taken hostage, Israeli officials say. Israel’s retaliatory war in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan health authorities, though their figures do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Many Palestinians view the Oct. 7 attack as a justified response to Israeli violations during the decades-long Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.

This year, the administration canceled its annual student speech. ByMaia Coleman For the past two years, commencement speakers at the City University of New York School of Law have made support for Palestinians and opposition to Israel a focus of their speeches. The backlash was intense. So this year, well before other campuses across the United States faced upheaval over pro-Palestinian student demonstrations, the CUNY law school administration took a new tack. In September, before the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, the school announced that there would be no student speaker at all at this year’s commencement ceremony. The choice is now drawing its own backlash and has brought more controversy to the event. This spring, several students at the school sued university officials, saying that the school was suppressing speech and infringing on their First Amendment rights by not allowing a student-elected speaker to give an address. Two guests who had been scheduled to speak — Deborah N. Archer, a civil rights lawyer and president of the American Civil Liberties Union, and Muhammad U. Faridi, a litigator — recently withdrew from the event. The ceremony will now have no outside speakers and no keynote address, the law school said. The school also announced in April that it would host its May 23 ceremony off-campus, at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, in a departure from the ceremonies of the past two years, which have been held at CUNY facilities. The Apollo requires guests to have tickets and has a smaller capacity than the school’s previous venues, the law school said. In an email to CUNY students announcing her decision to withdraw, Ms. Archer said she felt compelled to decline “under the circumstances.” “I cannot, as a leader of the nation’s oldest guardian of free expression, participate in an event in which students believe that their voices are being excluded,” Ms. Archer wrote.

ByIsabel Kershner Reporting from Jerusalem If the headlines in Israel were anything to go by, the request by the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor for anarrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuseemed to have granted the Israeli leader one of the most fortuitous turnarounds in his long and turbulent political career. “The Hypocrisy of The Hague,” blared Tuesday’s front page of Yediot Ahronot, a popular mainstream daily that has often been critical of Mr. Netanyahu. Echoing the outrage expressed by Israelis across the political spectrum, and abandoning any semblance of impartiality, the front page denounced “the intolerable gall” of the chief prosecutor,Karim Khan, for what it described as putting Israel alongside the leaders of Hamas who “seek to annihilate it.” The threat of arrest warrants comes against Mr. Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, as well as three leaders of Hamas, on charges of war crimes from the devastating Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel’s punishing retaliatory campaign in Gaza. It appeared to broadly galvanize Mr. Netanyahu’s opposition in his favor. Political rivals in Israel offered support. American officials, who had been critical of his plan to invade Rafah, roundly condemned the I.C.C. action.

A bystander and a professor were injured. ByStephanie Saul The Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Dartmouth College voted on Monday to censure the university’s president, Sian Leah Beilock, over her decision to summon the police to remove a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus, calling her action harmful to the community and disruptive to the university’s educational mission. The censure motion was adopted by a vote of 183 to 163, according to Justin Anderson, a spokesman for Dartmouth. The close vote illustrated the division on campus over Dr. Beilock’s decision on May 1, made just hours after the encampment had been erected on the college green. At the meeting, Dr. Beilock defended her actions, saying that she believed there was a reasonable and credible threat of violence. Monday’s vote was believed to be the first censure vote against a president of Dartmouth in its 255-year history. In a statement, the university noted that a censure vote had no practical effect. And the chair of Dartmouth’s board,Liz Lempres, applauded Dr. Beilock for her “strong leadership” in nearly impossible circumstances. “The board unequivocally and unanimously supports President Beilock,” she said in a statement. Eighty-nine people were arrested, including two faculty members, as the police moved in to clear the encampment this month.

ByMaria Cramer Last September, the New York Police Departmentsigned a sweeping agreement in federal courtthat was meant to end overwhelming responses to protests that often led to violent clashes, large-scale arrests and expensive civil rights lawsuits. The sight of hundreds of officers in tactical gearmoving in on pro-Palestinian demonstrators in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, on Saturdaysuggested to civil libertarians that the department might not abide by the agreement when it is fully implemented. At least two officers wearing the white shirts of commanders were filmed punching three protesters who were prone in the middle of a crosswalk. And film clips of recent campus protests showed some officers pushing and dragging students, a handful of whom later said they had been injured by the police, though many officers appeared to show restraint during the arrests. “I think members of the public are very concerned that the police will be unwilling or unable to meet their end of the bargain,” said Jennvine Wong, a staff attorney with Legal Aid, which, along with the New York Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit against the city over the department’s response to protests in 2020 afterthe killing of George Floyd. That lawsuit was later combined with a complaint filed by Letitia James, the state attorney general, over what she called widespread abuses during the Black Lives Matter protests. Last fall, police officials and Ms. James reached the agreement in federal court, intended to strike a new equilibrium between the department’s need to preserve public safety and the rights of protesters. The city, along with two major police unions, agreed to develop policies and training that would teach the department to respond gradually to demonstrations, rather than sending in large numbers of officers immediately, and to emphasize de-escalation over an immediate show of force. The implementation was expected to take three years. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

ByHurubie Meko A man who got into an argument with pro-Palestinian demonstrators before hitting one with his car on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on Tuesday has been charged with assault, according to the police. The man, Reuven Kahane, 57, was arguing with two demonstrators around 9 a.m. when he struck a 55-year-old woman with his vehicle, the police said. In reaction, the demonstrators hit Mr. Kahane’s car. Mr. Kahane was charged with second-degree assault. The demonstrator who was hit, Maryellen Novak, was treated at Weill Cornell Medical Center for minor injuries. She was arrested and charged with criminal mischief and unlawful assembly. The other demonstrator involved, John Rozendaal, 63, was also arrested and charged with criminal mischief. Mr. Kahane was arraigned Wednesday morning and released without bail. The Manhattan district attorney’s office declined to prosecute Ms. Novak and Mr. Rozendaal, according to a statement. Lawyers for Mr. Kahane, Sara Shulevitz and Mindy Meyer, said that “more facts will come to light” in the course of the case. “We’re confident that our client will be exonerated of all charges,” they said. According to public and genealogical records, Mr. Kahane is cousins with Rabbi Meir Kahane, the Brooklyn-born founder of the Jewish Defense League and leader of a militant anti-Arab fringe movement in Israelwho was killed shortly after addressing a Zionist conference in New York City in 1990.

U.N.

The Israeli government has shrugged off criticism from the United States and others to move ahead with its building plans, which come as tensions have soared in the West Bank since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel prompted all-out war in Gaza. “The West Bank is already in crisis,” the U.N.’s rights chief, Volker Türk, said, “yet, settler violence and settlement-related violations have reached shocking new levels, and risk eliminating any practical possibility of establishing a viable Palestinian state.” Roughly 500,000 Israelis live in settlements in the occupied West Bank, where the Israeli military rules over roughly 2.7 million Palestinians. Much of the Israeli right believes Israel should control the West Bank in perpetuity, while Palestinians see the area as integral to their aspirations for an independent state. Mr. Türk’s comments accompanied a report released by his office that said the expansion of settlements and a dramatic rise in associated violence and discrimination against Palestinians, particularly since Oct. 7, “have taken the West Bank to the brink of catastrophe.” Settler violence had already reached record levels in 2023, with 835 incidents recorded before the Oct. 7 attack. Since then, settler violence has skyrocketed, the U.N. said, with another 603 settler attacks reported. The U.N. reported nine Palestinians killed by settlers using firearms and 396 killed by Israeli security forces, with two other Palestinian deaths that could not be attributed. More than 1,200 Palestinian herders had been forced from their homes as a direct result of settler violence and close to 600 Palestinians, the U.N. reported. Israel’s latest plan to build 3,476 new settler homes follows construction of 23,000 new homes in the 12 months that ended in October, the U.N. human rights office reported, representing the fastest rate of expansion since monitoring started in 2017. The expansion represents a transfer of Israel’s population to occupied territory, which is prohibited under international law and amounts to a war crime, the U.N. said. The policies of Israel’s current government appear aligned to an unprecedented extent with the goals of its settler movement to expand long-term control over the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and to steadily integrate this occupied territory into Israel, the U.N. said. It cited the appointment of Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister and a settler, as an “additional minister” in the defense ministry with widespread powers over the West Bank, including over the designation of land, planning and property demolitions. Israel had recorded 468,000 Jewish Israelis in the West Bank at the end of 2022, the report noted and, in May 2023, Mr. Smotrich presented a two-year plan to attract another half-million Israelis to move there.

ByHiba Yazbek,Aaron Boxerman,Monika PronczukandThomas Fuller A day after President Biden announced plans for maritime aid delivery to the Gaza Strip, European leaders said Friday they would deliver aid by ship as early as the weekend. But aid groups and Gaza officials criticized shipments by air or sea as too cumbersome, urging that vastly more food and medicine be supplied by trucks. The complications of delivering aid to the hungry residents of Gaza were underlined on Friday when the authorities in Gaza said at least five Palestinians were killed and several others were wounded after they were struck by packages of humanitarian aid that were dropped from an aircraft. The United Nations has warned that five months of war and an Israeli blockade have left hundreds of thousands of Gazans on the brink of starvation, prompting a variety of proposals to speed the delivery of food and other vital needs. Israel insists on inspecting all supplies going into Gaza, and aid trucks have been allowed in through just two border crossings — one from Egypt and one from Israel — in southern Gaza. President Biden on Thursday night outlined a U.S. military plan to build a floating pier on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast to supply food, water, medicine and other necessities to civilians, saying the operation would “enable a massive increase” in the assistance entering the territory. The Pentagon press secretary, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, said in a news conference on Friday that the pier would help to deliver as many as two million meals a day. The Gaza Strip has a population of about 2.3 million. But U.S. officials said the project would take at least 30 to 60 days to complete, raising questions about how famine in Gaza will be staved off in the critical days ahead.

ByErica L. Green reporting from Washington President Biden said on Thursday that he and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel were headed toward a “come-to-Jesus meeting” over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, according to an audio clip of the president’s remarks posted on social media on Friday. Mr. Biden’s comment highlights the rising tensions between him and Mr. Netanyahu in recent weeks, as the civilian death toll in Gaza has risen inexorably and Mr. Biden has come under political pressure at home and abroad to do more to compel Israel to agree to a cease-fire. In recent days, Mr. Biden had expressed hope that at least a six-week cease-fire deal would be in place by Ramadan, the Muslim holy month that starts in a few days. But Israel and Hamas have reached an impasse in negotiations to recover vulnerable hostages taken during the Oct. 7 attack in Israel in exchange for a permanent cease-fire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. On Friday, when asked by reporters if a deal could still be reached by Ramadan, Mr. Biden said, “It’s looking tough.” The president’s earlier “come-to-Jesus” comments were captured on a hot microphone during what Mr. Biden thought was a private exchange with Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, after the State of the Union address. According to a recording of the conversation, Mr. Bennet encouraged the president to “keep pushing” on the issue of humanitarian assistance to Gaza as Israel fights its war against Hamas, a war for which the United States has provided funding and weaponry.

ByMarc Tracy A pro-Palestinian group slashed and spray-painteda century-old portrait of Arthur James Balfourat the University of Cambridge on Friday, defacing a painting of the British official whose pledge of support in 1917 for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people” helped pave the way to Israel’s founding three decades later. The group, Palestine Action,said in a statementthat the destruction of the portrait in Trinity College, Cambridge, was intended to call attention to “the bloodshed of the Palestinian people since the Balfour Declaration was issued,” particularly in light of the current conflict in Gaza. A spokeswoman for Trinity, whose alumni include King Charles III as well as Balfour himself, said in a statement on Friday that the college “regrets the damage caused to a portrait of Arthur James Balfour during public opening hours” and that it had notified the police. A Cambridge police statement said officers were on the scene to investigate a report of “criminal damage.” Palestine Action posted a video of a protester first spraying the portrait, painted in 1914 by Philip Alexius de László, with red paint and then slashing it with a sharp object. The group’s statement said Balfour had given away the homeland of the Palestinians — “a land that wasn’t his to give away” — touching off what it described as decades of oppression. Since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants invading southern Israelkilled approximately 1,200 peopleand abducted 240 others, Israeli bombings and invasions havekilled more than 30,000 people, according to Gaza health officials. Defacing art has become a popular protest tacticin recent years. It is perhaps most closely associated with environmentalists, who have targeted paintings by van Gogh, Vermeer and Monet. This year, two women from an environmental group entered the Louvre andflung soup at the Mona Lisa. Most of the paintings that have been targeted were covered or protected in some way, andvery few were damaged. In recent weeks, pro-Palestinian protesters have targeted art in New York. This week, a few dozen demonstrators disrupted the opening of an Israeli artist’s show at a Manhattan gallery,Hyperallergic reported.

U.S. officials sketched out the plan, which would make the United States more directly involved in delivering aid, hours before President Biden was scheduled to give his State of the Union address on Thursday evening. Details for what they described as a floating pier off Gaza would be included in the speech, the officials said. The White House called it an “emergency mission” that would allow hundreds of truckloads of additional aid to be delivered to Gaza via the temporary port, which would be attached to some kind of temporary causeway. Briefing reporters, officials said it could take more than 30 to 60 days to implement, and involve hundreds or thousands of U.S. troops on ships just off shore, in keeping with Mr. Biden’s mandate that no American soldiers be on the ground inside Gaza as the conflict rages. The port would be constructed in cooperation with other countries in the region, the officials said. American officials said that they had “worked closely” with Israelis as they developed the seaport initiative, but they did not specify whether Israel would provide direct assistance or support for its construction or operation. Shani Sasson, a spokeswoman for COGAT, the Israeli agency which regulates aid to Palestinians in Gaza, did not respond to a request for comment. One Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic negotiations, said that under the latest plan, aid donated by the United Arab Emirates would be sent to Cyprus, where it would eventually be inspected, then transported by ship to the coast of Gaza.

War in Gaza Presents Biden With Challenges at Home and Abroad,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/us/politics/gaza-war-biden-state-union.html,2024-03-07T20:25:09+0000,Domestic and international anger over Israel’s response to the Oct. 7 attacks has complicated President Biden’s diplomatic and re-election efforts.,"Nearly five months since Hamas militants attacked and killed about 1,200 people in Israel, President Biden has been swept into the resulting upheaval in the region.

ByMichael Crowley Nearly five months since Hamas militants attacked and killed about 1,200 people in Israel, President Biden has been swept into the resulting upheaval in the region. As he prepares to address the nation, he finds himself navigating a wider Middle East emergency with profound moral, political and security implications for his presidency. Early sympathy for Israel after the Oct. 7 attacks has given way to domestic and international anger over the suffering in Gaza. Israel’s subsequent military campaign to crush Hamas has now killed more than 30,000 Palestinians, according to officials in Gaza, with dire shortages of food, water and medicine creating a humanitarian crisis. Because Israel’s military heavily depends on American-supplied weapons and munitions, Mr. Biden is under pressure at home and abroad to rein in Israel and alleviate the suffering in Gaza. But despite increasingly adamant calls for Israel to do more to protect civilians and provide them with aid, U.S. officials say that is not happening. Even so, Mr. Biden has restrained his criticism of Israel’s right-wing government and resisted demands for restricting American aid to Israel, often reminding the world that Israel was brutally attacked and has a right to self-defense. He has ordered airdrops of aid into Gaza to supplement the limited truck convoys that enter the territory from Israel. But aid workers say those aerial supplies will make little difference. Seeking to do more, Mr. Biden will announce a plan for the United States to build a floating pier off Gaza that can receive more supplies. U.S. officials say their best hope is to help broker a deal between Israel and Hamas to pause the fighting for several weeks, allow for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and enable a surge of humanitarian supplies into the territory. Some U.S. officials think that such a pause in combat could evolve into a longer-term cease-fire. Talks among several nations to strike a deal have been underway for weeks, and U.S. officials say that Israel has signed off on an offer. But Hamas has yet to agree.

Nervous Democrats Press Biden on Gaza Ahead of State of the Union,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/us/politics/biden-gaza.html,2024-03-07T10:05:52+0000,"Mainstream Democratic lawmakers want the president to speak out more forcefully for the policies that his administration has embraced, including a cease-fire.",Follow live updates on Biden’s State of the Union address.,"Advertisement Supported by Mainstream Democratic lawmakers want the president to speak out more forcefully for the policies that his administration has embraced, including a cease-fire. ByJonathan Weisman Follow live updates onBiden’s State of the Union address. Mainstream Democrats, watching the politics around Israel’s war in Gaza shift against them, are pressing President Biden to become far more outspoken in his criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government and far more upfront in his demands for a long-term solution to the conflict that includes a Palestinian state. At the outset of the war, with memories fresh from Hamas’s terrorist attack on Israel that took around 1,200 lives,Jewish Democrats who had grown restivemore than a year ago over Mr. Netanyahu’s governance largely rallied aroundMr. Biden as he sided firmlywith Israel. But as the death toll in Gaza rises inexorably, many are pleading with the president not so much to change policies but to become the voice of his administration’s own demands for a Ramadan cease-fire, more humanitarian aid, more restraint of Jewish settler violence and a long-term peace that includes a Palestinian state. “We are hoping that a strategy for peace and an end to this nightmare will be laid out at the State of the Union,” Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said on Wednesday. “Nobody can question Biden’s commitment to the security of Israel, and nobody can question his commitment over the course of his career to human rights and international law. Now is the time when the world needs to see American leadership for peace.” Mr. Raskin, returning to earlier criticism of Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, the most right-wing in Israel’s history, added, “Democrats feel we don’t take orders from right-wing politicians in America, and we shouldn’t be taking orders from right-wing politicians in another country.” More than a dozen Jewish Democrats in the House spearheadeda critical letter late last monthdemanding Mr. Biden “redouble” his efforts to achieve a cease-fire that facilitates more humanitarian aid to starving Gazans. Many of the same lawmakers on Wednesday warned against an Israeli strike on the city of Rafah, along the Gaza-Egypt border, where hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians have sheltered.

ByMark Landler Reporting from London When Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s war cabinet, met David Cameron, Britain’s foreign secretary, in London on Wednesday, he got a sharp message that Israel must do more to allow humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza. It was the kind of minister-level meeting that would normally draw modest attention amid the flurry of high-level diplomacy that has enveloped the Israel-Hamas war. But Mr. Gantz and Mr. Cameron are no mere functionaries. Mr. Gantz, a former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, is a popular political rival of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Mr. Netanyahu expressed deep displeasure at what he viewed as an unsanctioned trip by a would-be Israeli leader. Mr. Cameron, a former prime minister, has enjoyed uncommon latitude as foreign secretary, speaking out forcefully on issues like Gaza and the war in Ukraine on international trips, where he is often treated as though he were still in his old job. The unusual optics of the meeting — almost two shadow leaders — speak to the peculiar domestic politics in each country. Israel is in the grip of a devastating war that has pulled Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz intoa temporary alliance. Britain is in the twilight stages of an era of Conservative-led governments, with a prime minister, Rishi Sunak, who ismore occupied with a general electionlater this year than with foreign policy. For Britain, diplomats and experts said, deploying Mr. Cameron to deliver a tough message to Israel is valuable because it will register more than if it came from a standard-issue cabinet minister. It also spares Mr. Sunak the political risk of pressing Mr. Netanyahu directly and potentially being rebuffed. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByRonen Bergman,Edward WongandJulian E. Barnes Ronen Bergman and Edward Wong reported from Istanbul, and Julian Barnes from Washington. Talks between Israel and Hamas over the release of dozens of Israeli hostages held in Gaza have stalled, dimming hopes that a deal could be reached before Ramadan begins in a few days, according to several people briefed on the conversations. Negotiators had beendiscussing a proposalfor an initial six-week cease-fire during which Hamas would release about 40 people — including women, elderly and ill hostages, and five female Israeli soldiers — for a substantial number of Palestinian prisoners. The discussions included terms for releasing at least 15 prisoners convicted of serious acts of terrorism who would be exchanged for the female soldiers. The terms also said Israel would release hundreds of other detainees or prisoners, at an average of 10 Palestinians for every Israeli civilian freed, officials said. American officials had said that they hoped to reach an agreement to release some hostages and put in place a temporary pause in fighting before Ramadan, which is expected to start this Sunday. President Biden expressed confidence last week that a deal was within reach. But in recent days, Hamas has backed away from the proposed agreement and made demands that Israel refuses to meet, according to officials briefed on the talks. The negotiations had been taking place in Doha, Qatar, before they moved to Cairo in recent days. John F. Kirby, a National Security Council spokesman, said on Wednesday that while the United States was disappointed that an agreement had not been reached, negotiators were still confident in the parameters of the deal they had helped negotiate.

ByAdam Sella reporting from Tel Aviv The Israeli government has decided against putting new restrictions on access to an important mosque in Jerusalem during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a move that may reduce tensions at a site that has long been a flashpoint for unrest. At a meeting on Tuesday night led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, security officials decided to let a similar number of worshipers enterthe Aqsa Mosque compoundduring Ramadan as they had in previous years, Mr. Netanyahu’s office said. Ramadan, whose start is tied to the sighting of the crescent moon, is expected to begin in a few days. Israel has long restricted access to the compound, which is sacred to Muslims and Jews alike, during Ramadan for Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied West Bank. This year, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister,called on the governmentto impose limits on Arab citizens of Israel as well. The decision on Tuesday put an end to the plan promoted by Mr. Ben-Gvir, but it allowed some wiggle room. “A weekly assessment of the security and safety aspects will be held; a decision will be made accordingly,” a statement from the prime minister’s office said. The mosque compound has regularly been the scene of violent clashes. Confrontations at the site in May 2021contributed to the outbreakof an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas. With Ramadan nearing as the current Israel-Hamas war enters its sixth month, the fear of escalation at the site has intensified. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden said that if a cease-fire deal was not reached by Ramadan, “it’s going to be very dangerous.” Mansour Abbas, an Arab Israeli member of the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, praised the decision. “I congratulate the Prime Minister for the responsible decision to allow Muslim worshipers at Al Aqsa Mosque freedom of worship,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Mr. Ben-Gvir, however, expressed concern that the decision would undermine Israel’s effort to destroy the militant group Hamas, which attacked Israel on Oct. 7. “Hamas celebrations on the Temple Mount ≠ complete victory,” he wrote on X, using the name used by Jews to refer to Al Aqsa. Hamas previously condemned any Israeli restrictions on worship at Al Aqsa. On Monday, a Hamas leader called on Palestinians to turn the mosque into a site of confrontation. Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Jerusalem should “turn every moment of Ramadan into a clash and confrontation with the enemy to protect Al Aqsa,” Osama Hamdan, a Hamas leader based in Beirut, told a conference of Muslim scholars by video. In Muslim tradition, the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven from the site of Al Aqsa, and tens of thousands of Muslims visit the mosque every day during Ramadan. For Jews, the area is revered as the Temple Mount because it was the site of two Jewish temples in antiquity that remain central to Jewish identity. Matthew Mpoke Biggcontributed reporting.

We’re told one day that the war is ending and then the opposite the next day.” ByAdam RasgonandAbu Bakr Bashir reporting from Jerusalem and London When President Biden suggested last week thata cease-fire was imminent, Khalil el-Halabi was elated. Mr. Halabi, a 70-year-old retired U.N. official, paraded through a cluster of tents in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, delivering the news to people displaced by the war, prompting cheers and claps. But the joy didn’t last: The next morning, reports that gaps remained between Israel and Hamas brought him back down to earth. “It’s a form of psychological torture,” Mr. Halabi said. “It’s unbearable. We’re told one day that the war is ending and then the opposite the next day.” Palestinians in Gaza, whose lives may depend on a cease-fire, have followed news of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas with rapt attention. But a stream of conflicting reports has sent them on an exhausting emotional roller-coaster as they huddle in crowded apartments, tent cities and shelters. The tension is especially acute in Rafah, which is densely packed with more than one million displaced people. Israel has repeatedly threatened to invade the city as it tries to root out the leadership of Hamas. The United States is pressing for a cease-fire to be negotiated ahead of Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month that begins in about a week. On Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris said a deal was on the table for a cease-fire of at least six-weeks, one that would include the release of hostages held by militants in Gaza and the entry of a “significant” amount of aid. The U.S.-backed proposal is to exchange scores of Palestinian prisoners and detainees for 40 hostages in Gaza, officials say. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByAdam Sella,Helene CooperandThomas Fuller Israelis largely welcomed a U.N. report that supported allegations of sexual violence during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack, even as a top Israeli official accused the United Nations of not doing enough to address the findings — a sign of the rising tensions between them. The U.N. report, released on Monday, found both “reasonable grounds to believe” that sexual violence against multiple people had occurred in at least three locations in Israel, and “clear and convincing information” that hostages taken to Gaza on Oct. 7 had been subjected to sexual violence, including rape. On Tuesday, President Isaac Herzog of Israelsaid on Xthat the report was “of immense importance,” and he lauded it for its “moral clarity and integrity.” But Israel Katz, Israel’s foreign minister, accused the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, in a social media post of making a concerted effort to “forget the report and avoid making the necessary decisions.” In protest, Mr. Katz recalled Israel’s representative to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, for consultations — a step short of withdrawing the ambassador for a longer term. Mr. Erdan was on a plane back to Israel on Tuesday, he said. A U.N. spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said he did not accept — or even understand — the criticism, and that the report was done “thoroughly and expeditiously” and that “in no way, shape or form did the secretary general do anything to ‘bury’ the report.” U.N. officials alerted journalists in advance of the report’s release and held a news conference to discuss it, and the report received extensive news coverage. Mr. Guterres has been an outspoken critic of Israel’s invasion of the Gaza Strip and has been pushing for an immediate and binding cease-fire. And there is deep distrust of the United Nations among Israelis, who see the body as biased against their country — a fact that was noted in the report on Oct. 7.

How the ‘Uncommitted’ Effort to Protest Biden Has Spread in Super Tuesday States,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/us/politics/biden-uncommitted-vote-super-tuesday.html,2024-03-05T22:58:53+0000,"The campaigns have been fragmented, organized with far less time and resources than Michigan’s operation.","Organizers in several Super Tuesday states are calling on voters to oppose President Biden at the ballot box over his stance on the war in Israel and Gaza, building on momentum that began last month in Michigan."," Advertisement The campaigns have been fragmented, organized with far less time and resources than Michigan’s operation. ByAnjali Huynh Organizers in several Super Tuesday states are calling on voters to oppose President Biden at the ballot box over his stance on the war in Israel and Gaza, building on momentum that began last month in Michigan. More than 101,000 Michigandersvoted “uncommitted”in the state’s Democratic primary, after a group of young Arab Americans started a campaign encouraging voters to protest Mr. Biden’s alliance with Israel — earning two delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Inspired by the campaign, pro-Palestinian groups around the country started similar efforts to push the president to call for a permanent cease-fire. In Colorado, a group of Palestinian activists scrambled to create a social media campaign for the state’s“noncommitted delegate” optionwhile Michigan returns were still coming in last week. In Minnesota, organizers knocked on doors and held get-out-the-vote events to promotethe “uncommitted” category, with outreach to Muslim Somali Americans and young voters. And in Massachusetts, thousands of protestersat a rally in Cambridgechanted “no preference,” the similar designated protest option. The campaigns have been fragmented, organized with far less time and resources than Michigan’s operation. Many were planned in a matter of days, well after early voting had already begun, and several organizers declined to articulate specific benchmarks for what would constitute success on Tuesday night beyond the goal of seeing Mr. Biden move his position. (Organizers in Minnesota said they were aiming for 5,000 “Uncommitted” votes, a low target that was about double what the category received in the 2020 Democratic primary.) The other states also lack Michigan’s position in the broader backlash to Mr. Biden’s policy: The state has a sizable Arab American population, for whom the issue has been particularly painful, and ahead of the vote, prominent Democrats in the statewarned about the potentialfor political peril. The “uncommitted” effort drew the backing of Representative Rashida Tlaib, a member of the group of liberals in the House known as the squad. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByHelene Cooper The United States made a second round of airdrops of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, as the Biden administration continued its efforts to prevent a greater humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territory. U.S. Air Force cargo planes dropped 36,800 ready-to-eat meals, in a joint operation with the Jordanian Air Force, “to provide essential relief to civilians affected by the ongoing conflict,” U.S. Central Command said in a statement on Tuesday. It said that army troops trained in aerial delivery were part of the airdrop, and that it was planning more such missions. However, the Pentagon said on Tuesday that the United States did not intend to send its troops into Gaza to strengthen the aid distribution process. “At this time there are no plans to put U.S. forces on the ground in Gaza,” Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, said at a news conference. Some aid experts and humanitarian groups have criticized the American airdrops as insufficient and largely symbolic, given the scale of the hunger problem facing Gaza after five months of war. Cargo planes can only move a fraction of the food a convoy of trucks can deliver, experts say, and a better solution would be for the United States to persuade Israel to open more border crossings and speed up inspections. The operation on Tuesday followed a first round of airdrops on Saturday, two days aftermore than 100 Palestinians were killedas Israeli forces opened fire around a convoy of aid trucks in northern Gaza. Doctors at Gaza hospitals said most of the casualties were from gunfire. The Israeli military said most of the victims were trampled as they tried to seize the cargo, although Israeli officials acknowledged that troops had fired on some people who they said had threatened them. After the convoy killings, President Biden said the United States would find new ways to get aid to Palestinians in desperate need because of Israel’s five-month military campaign to destroy Hamas. Only atrickle of aidhas been reaching northern Gaza via land, but aid groups have criticized airdrops asineffective. The amount of aid delivered by a French plane in anairdroplast week was much less than a single truckload. Although Mr. Biden has implored Israel, which has largely sealed its border with Gaza, to clear the way for more aid deliveries, the demand for food, water and medicine there remains huge. Those conditions have put Mr. Biden under political pressure to do more to help the Palestinians, even as the United States supplies Israel with military hardware. Despite his frustrations with Israel’s political leadership, Mr. Biden has not threatened to put limits on American military aid to the country. Helene Cooperis a Pentagon correspondent.

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise. And this is “The Daily.” Late last week, an effort to get food into northern Gaza turned deadly, as thousands of desperate Gazans descended on aid trucks and Israeli troops tasked with guarding those trucks opened fire. But exactly how people died and who was responsible remains contested. Today, my colleague Hiba Yazbek on what we know about what happened and what it tells us about hunger in Gaza. It’s Tuesday, March 5. So Hiba, we are now in the fifth month of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. And for weeks, we’ve been hearing about negotiations over a cease fire and a hostage exchange. Then, late last week, there was a disaster surrounding an aid convoy that was brought into Gaza. You’ve been reporting on what happened. Tell us about it. So last Thursday, there was a deadly disaster involving civilians, possibly the deadliest disaster since the war started nearly five months ago, In which 118 Palestinians were killed and more than 760 were wounded in Gaza City. But there are conflicting reports on how they died and what exactly happened. The Israeli military has one account of what happened and the Gaza health ministry and witnesses have another account. So my colleagues and I started digging into the details. We started calling people, piecing together a picture of what had actually happened there. And what did you find when you guys started really looking into this? So first, let me just give you the context of what happened. This happened in Northern Gaza, the place that has been at war the longest. That’s where Israeli ground forces began their invasion of the Gaza Strip. Many people have left the North. But we do know that some 300,000 people are still there. The people who have remained there are really living through very desperate conditions. Very little aid has come in to the North of Gaza since the war started and especially in recent weeks. Food is barely available for the people who’ve remained there. The UN has been warning of a famine that is looming over the territory. Hiba, why is there so little aid getting into Northern Gaza in particular? Well, first of all, there’s less aid getting into the Gaza Strip in general, not just the North. There’s multiple reasons as to why that is. But one of the main reasons is that Israel itself has been very slow to approve permits and often denies permits for aid trucks and aid convoys to come in, specifically to the North. Because Israel says that they don’t want the aid to end up in the hands of Hamas, that they don’t want them to get a hold of the packages. Got it. When Israel does approve the permits and the aid trucks start their journeys, there’s multiple hurdles that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people. Some of these hurdles include the widespread destruction in Gaza. There’s vast damage across the Gaza Strip. Roads have been destroyed, there’s rubble everywhere, and it’s very difficult for the trucks to actually move through that rubble and through those roads. Then these aid convoys have to go through multiple Israeli checkpoints on the way. There’s often significant delays at these checkpoints by Israeli soldiers who are inspecting the aid. This makes it hard for the trucks to make it from where they enter in the South all the way to the North in the specific safety window that they’re given. Sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they got delayed so much that they can’t keep going. Hm. But there’s a particular problem with the North, where fighting has been going on the longest. The civil order is now breaking down, essentially. We know that frequent Israeli strikes on Palestinian policemen meant that there’s really no one to run security for official groups and for aid convoys, leaving them vulnerable to attacks by local gangs who are trying to steal the aid and sell it or profit off of it, and also, hungry and desperate civilians who are trying to grab the aid and take as much as they can, which means that they end up stealing some of it, looting some of it, while it’s still on the way. Right. So it’s lawlessness and effectively social order breakdown. I mean, this is kind of the downstream effects of extended war in a particular place. There’s a power vacuum. That situation can be very difficult for an organization like the United Nations to be able to operate safely. Right. The few aid trucks that do come in have had to either suspend their aid deliveries into the North or have not been able to deliver aid there. The last time UNRWA, the UN agency in charge of Palestinian refugees, tried to bring trucks to the North was nearly a month ago. But they said that one of their convoys came under fire. Another major aid provider, the World Food Program, said that they haven’t delivered aid there in over three weeks. They cited all of the reasons we talked about for this suspension. So while aid hasn’t been coming into the North, people have been growing more desperate and hungry and the situation there has been getting worse, which has been raising international alarm. There’s been increased calls on Israel to let aid go through to the North and to alleviate the suffering of the residents there. So Israel partnered with these local Palestinian businessmen in Gaza, and they promised to secure the aid convoys that the businessmen would supply and that would make their way into the North. They successfully did this three times last week. So people started being very hopeful that more would come, and ahead of the fourth delivery, they started to gather at this distribution point right outside of Gaza City in the North. That brings us to Thursday’s incident. [MUSIC PLAYING] So last Thursday around 4:45 AM, around 38 aid trucks reached this distribution point. They start getting closer to the crowds of people who had camped there overnight waiting for this aid to come. When the people see the trucks coming, they’re very desperate. They surround them. They get on top of them. Then at some point, Israeli soldiers start firing shots. Then it turned violent very fast. It ended with 118 Palestinians dead and 760 injured. This is where the accounts diverge. OK. So let’s start with the Israeli account. What do they say happened? So the Israeli military said that it was trying to secure the convoy and it had tanks nearby to make sure that the convoy reached the area. It did acknowledge that its troops had opened fire at the crowd, but they said that they opened fire when a violent crowd or a violent mob approached their troops and endangered their lives. They said the shots that were fired weren’t really the reason why so many people died, but the reason that so many people died was because, in the chaos of all of it, they trampled each other and many had died from suffocation or trampling, and also that the trucks had run over some of the people who were trying to run away. Oh, God. So the Israelis don’t deny actually shooting, but they say it was more about controlling the crowd, kind of as warning shots type thing, and that this was not the way people actually died. They say the way people actually died was suffocation or being crushed by the aid trucks themselves. Right. What did the Gazan health authorities say? So the Gazan health authorities have actually been calling this the flour massacre, or the massacre of the hungry stomachs. Because what they’re saying is that Israeli forces fired at a crowd of hungry and desperate people who were waiting for aid. Witnesses and Palestinians who were there have said that although some people were trampled and possibly run over by the trucks, that was not the main reason for the high death toll. Most of the people who were injured or killed were injured and killed by Israeli fire. So the Gazan health authorities are essentially saying this was a massacre by Israel. Right. Do we know, Hiba, what actually did happen? What have you guys found in your reporting? Well, the Israeli military released drone footage that it claimed showed a mass stampede in which Gazans are trampled. But that video only added to the confusion of the sequence of events. The quality and the lengths of the clips made it more difficult to confirm these claims. Right. It was just grainy. There was no sound. You saw people scramble and run, but you didn’t understand why. Right. The drone footage was heavily edited. It left out key moments. But it did show hundreds of people circling around the trucks and hoping to catch a bag of flour. Then suddenly, we see people start to panic and run in multiple directions. Then they released another clip in which we see two Israeli tanks that are positioned about a quarter mile down the road. Then we see about a dozen bodies lying around them. We see people crawling and ducking for cover. [CROWD NOISE] But we did have another video that was released by Al Jazeera. [GUNFIRE] And it showed a crowd near the aid convoy. And it also captured the sound of gunfire and showed multiple tracer rounds, which is a special type of ammunition that helps troops fine tune their targeting when it’s dark. The tracer rounds originated from the direction of a nearby Israeli military base. So although that did not conclude that the shots came from the direction of the Israeli military, it did add another layer of evidence. So Hiba, it sounds like these videos are suggestive but not conclusive. But what did the people you spoke to on the ground say, the eyewitnesses and survivors and doctors you spoke with. Right. We spoke to witnesses and survivors as well as doctors at the hospitals that have taken in the people who were wounded and killed. They said that most of the people had died or were wounded by gunshots. The doctor who runs one of the four main hospitals in the area that took in the casualties told me that out of the 13 people who were killed and the 170 people who were wounded that the hospital took in, all of the injuries were of gunshot wounds. He said that they didn’t see any injuries that coincided with those of a stampede or people being run over by trucks. That account echoes the ones that we’ve heard from witnesses and people who were there, who saw people get shot and fall to the ground next to them. But in the chaos of everything, people were not checking who’s dead and who’s wounded. They were just taking the flour, and they were running for their lives. And although the accounts differ on both sides, what we do know is that many hungry and desperate people died while trying to get food and secure aid in a place where famine is looming and starvation is rampant. That’s what I spent the last few weeks reporting on. I’m trying to understand how people in the North of Gaza specifically are surviving with such little food. We’ll be right back. So Hiba, I want to talk about what people are doing to survive in Northern Gaza. But before we get to that, what is the big picture on the state of hunger in Gaza? Hunger has reached unprecedented levels in Gaza and specifically in Northern Gaza. We’re starting to already see reports of children dying from malnutrition and dehydration. This week, the health ministry said that 15 children have died from malnutrition and dehydration at just one of Northern Gaza’s hospitals. Wow, 15 children have actually died? Yes. We also have the UN and aid organizations saying that one in six children in Northern Gaza were acutely malnutritioned and that more than 90 percent of children under two are facing severe food poverty. The UN humanitarian coordinator said that a quarter of all Gazan residents are one step away from famine. How exactly are people surviving, Hiba? I mean, you’re talking to people in Northern Gaza. What are they saying? I’ve been reporting on hunger for weeks. I’ve talked to people about what they’re doing in order to survive with such little food. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. I recently talked to one woman whose experience is very typical in Northern Gaza. Her name is Ghada Krayem. She’s a 23-year-old woman from the North who stayed in the North and didn’t flee. Tell me about Ghada. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. Ghada is one of 10 kids. She has six sisters and three brothers. She’s actually Gaza’s first female solar power engineer. She’s won many awards internationally. She’s also the sole provider for her family. She’s used the money that she won from these grants and competitions to help her family through this war. With that money, she actually stockpiled a bunch of food in the beginning of the war, expecting the situation to deteriorate. She bought flour and milk and canned food and everything they might need. They stockpiled it in their home. How is it that they’re still in Northern Gaza? Well, actually, they tried to stay in their home for as long as they possibly could, until the ground fighting really basically reached their doorstep. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. At one point, early on during Israel’s ground invasion of the North — [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. — Israeli soldiers came to their building and they forced them out. They asked everyone to leave the building, and they detained all of the men and the boys, who were later released. She was forced to leave with nothing. They took nothing with them, like many other Gazans. And they moved. They moved 12 times since. Wow. One of those times was to the South, where they got there and they realized that it actually wasn’t much safer. It wasn’t better for them. So they realized that they should probably just go back to the North and stay as close as possible to their home in case they’re able to go back later. But that never happened because Israeli forces took up their home as a military base and they were there for two weeks, she said. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. After they’d left, two weeks later, she went back to check on her home. It was burned. There was nothing left, including the food that she’d stockpiled. Now she’s sheltering with 50 members of her extended family, including children, in a two bedroom apartment in the North. 50 people in a two bedroom apartment? That is extraordinary. So what did they do for food early in the war? Well, she told me that in the beginning of the war, they still were able to find some things to buy and eat, like rice and vegetables. But — [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. She said that by the end of December, basically, when aid to the North became less frequent and things that they were eating had started to run out, including flour, which became much less available and much more expensive. They didn’t know what to do. I mean, they had nothing to eat, so they started mixing water with starch to eat. They were having one meal a day. And the children were constantly hungry, so they had to find an alternative. That alternative was animal food. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. So she told me that they started grinding up, really, any animal food that they could find. So rabbit food and bird food and hay and fodder, really anything that they could get their hands on. They would use that to make bread with. But the bread was very dry, and it smelled bad, it tasted bad, and it made their stomachs hurt. But she said that the one that was the worst for her was the bird food. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. She said the bird food tasted and smelled as if you were sitting with a bunch of chicken. The smell was very bad and the taste was even worse. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. But she told me that even though this stuff tasted and smelled bad, they really tried to make it as less awful as possible. She told me that one of her cousins sheltering with her loved to bake, and she made really tasty sweets before the war. So basically, she tried to make the most out of these ingredients. She was making desserts using the corn mill and the rabbit food. She was also making other savory dishes that they liked and they ate frequently before the war. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. She used the animal feed to make maftoul, which is the Palestinian version of couscous. So she was making it with the ground up animal feed? Yes. But that was still not enough. At that point, Ghada and her family were only eating one meal a day and that was not enough for them or the children in the family. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. She told me that her little sister, two-year-old Elene, who is actually the youngest person sheltering with them, was hungry all the time. She was going to sleep crying and waking up crying. And she loved milk, but they ran out of milk more than two months ago. So what they’ve been doing is basically giving her expired juice. It was actually not even juice, it’s a concentrated juice that they would mix with water. Because it was expired, it was making her sick. But that was the only thing that they could give her in place of milk. When they were able to, they would give her sugar cane that they would find in the market and lemons as a snack. Sometimes when those weren’t even available, they would just give her gum to chew on and stop crying, to silence her hunger. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. So I asked her if they had been able to get any aid since the war started. She told me that her brother Muhammad, who’s 30 years old, had been going to the distribution site and sleeping on the beach just waiting for aid. He would leave at 7:00 in the morning and come back at 3:00 AM. He slept there for three days this week. So her brother had been sleeping on the beach in hopes that there would be aid dropped off here. So what happened? So after waiting for hours near the distribution site on Thursday, he saw the eight trucks coming. And along with the crowd, he ran towards them. Suddenly, when the chaos erupted, he just started seeing people dropping to the ground. He’s actually deaf and mute. So he didn’t know what was happening. He just saw people get shot and fall to the ground in front of him. She told me that he saw someone get shot in the head right next to him. God. In the middle of all the chaos and the bloodshed, he was actually able to grab a bag of flour. He just took it and started running really fast. He was just trying to get away and hold on to that bag of flour that he was able to get. While leaving the site, he saw this little kid who was also able to grab a bag of flour. But she said that he told her that the kid was stopped by local gang members who had attacked him and grabbed the bag of flour from him. They stole it from him. Ghada’s brother just kept running until he got home, finally. He came home after three days of sleeping in the sand with a bag of flour. God, a terrifying night. Mhm. But that was the first time they’ve had flour in months, since December, basically. So obviously, they wanted to make bread. But that bag was a 25 kilogram bag of flour. Again, they were 50 people sheltering in one apartment. So they had to make it last them as long as possible so it could feed all the members of the family. So actually what they’re doing now is they’re mixing the flour with animal feed still. They’re doing one cup of flour with three cups of animal feed to stretch it out for as long as possible. They’re making bread with it. Wow. She said that it was better, but still not normal bread. It was not what they were craving. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. They’ve been through so much since the war started. They’ve seen people killed. They’ve seen dead bodies. They’ve been displaced 12 times. They’ve lost friends and family members. But she said that now with the hunger and the starvation in the North, it’s really the worst thing they’ve gone through since the beginning of the war. She said that she’s seeing people, kids who are rummaging through trash, trying to find anything to eat. So she said that people were still going back to that same distribution site. She even said that more people were going back on the beach and waiting and camping out and sleeping there, hoping for more aid to come. She also said that her brother, Muhammad, was also going back every day since Thursday, hoping to get another bag of flour. Because he was so hungry that he wanted to eat anything, and risking his life for a bag of flour was worth it. Despite the fact that so many people had died on Thursday trying to get flour, the fact that some people did come home with a bag of flour, that was enough for them and others to go back there in hopes that more was going to come. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. Hiba, thank you. Thank you, Sabrina. Over the weekend, the Biden administration airdropped food into Gaza for the first time. Vice President Kamala Harris called for a cease fire, a position she pressed with a member of Israel’s war cabinet, Benny Gantz, at the White House on Monday. Meanwhile, 15 trucks were dispatched to Northern Gaza on Monday. But at least five were looted along the way, and it was unclear how many reached their intended destination. We’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] Here’s what else you should know today. On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not bar former President Donald Trump from running for another term, rejecting a challenge to Trump’s eligibility that had threatened to upend the presidential race. The case arose from a challenge brought by Colorado voters who cited Section III of the 14th Amendment, a provision adopted after the Civil War to forbid those who had taken an oath to support the Constitution from holding office if they engaged in insurrection. The justices agreed that individual states may not bar candidates from the presidency under that constitutional provision. It was a unanimous decision that was largely expected. And a United Nations report released on Monday found, quote, “reasonable grounds to believe that sexual violence, including rape was committed in at least three locations in Israel during the October 7 attack, the Nova Music Festival site, Road 232, and Kibbutz Re’im.” The experts also said they had found circumstantial evidence that could indicate sexual violence had occurred with a number of victims, mostly women, who were found fully or partially naked, bound, and shot. In addition, the UN group said it had found clear and convincing information, based on firsthand accounts from released hostages, that sexual violence, including rape, was inflicted against some women during their time in captivity in Gaza. The report said that the UN team had also heard accounts of sexual violence against Palestinians that implicated Israeli security forces and settlers.

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise. And this is “The Daily.” Late last week, an effort to get food into northern Gaza turned deadly, as thousands of desperate Gazans descended on aid trucks and Israeli troops tasked with guarding those trucks opened fire. But exactly how people died and who was responsible remains contested. Today, my colleague Hiba Yazbek on what we know about what happened and what it tells us about hunger in Gaza. It’s Tuesday, March 5. So Hiba, we are now in the fifth month of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. And for weeks, we’ve been hearing about negotiations over a cease fire and a hostage exchange. Then, late last week, there was a disaster surrounding an aid convoy that was brought into Gaza. You’ve been reporting on what happened. Tell us about it. So last Thursday, there was a deadly disaster involving civilians, possibly the deadliest disaster since the war started nearly five months ago, In which 118 Palestinians were killed and more than 760 were wounded in Gaza City. But there are conflicting reports on how they died and what exactly happened. The Israeli military has one account of what happened and the Gaza health ministry and witnesses have another account. So my colleagues and I started digging into the details. We started calling people, piecing together a picture of what had actually happened there. And what did you find when you guys started really looking into this? So first, let me just give you the context of what happened. This happened in Northern Gaza, the place that has been at war the longest. That’s where Israeli ground forces began their invasion of the Gaza Strip. Many people have left the North. But we do know that some 300,000 people are still there. The people who have remained there are really living through very desperate conditions. Very little aid has come in to the North of Gaza since the war started and especially in recent weeks. Food is barely available for the people who’ve remained there. The UN has been warning of a famine that is looming over the territory. Hiba, why is there so little aid getting into Northern Gaza in particular? Well, first of all, there’s less aid getting into the Gaza Strip in general, not just the North. There’s multiple reasons as to why that is. But one of the main reasons is that Israel itself has been very slow to approve permits and often denies permits for aid trucks and aid convoys to come in, specifically to the North. Because Israel says that they don’t want the aid to end up in the hands of Hamas, that they don’t want them to get a hold of the packages. Got it. When Israel does approve the permits and the aid trucks start their journeys, there’s multiple hurdles that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people. Some of these hurdles include the widespread destruction in Gaza. There’s vast damage across the Gaza Strip. Roads have been destroyed, there’s rubble everywhere, and it’s very difficult for the trucks to actually move through that rubble and through those roads. Then these aid convoys have to go through multiple Israeli checkpoints on the way. There’s often significant delays at these checkpoints by Israeli soldiers who are inspecting the aid. This makes it hard for the trucks to make it from where they enter in the South all the way to the North in the specific safety window that they’re given. Sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they got delayed so much that they can’t keep going. Hm. But there’s a particular problem with the North, where fighting has been going on the longest. The civil order is now breaking down, essentially. We know that frequent Israeli strikes on Palestinian policemen meant that there’s really no one to run security for official groups and for aid convoys, leaving them vulnerable to attacks by local gangs who are trying to steal the aid and sell it or profit off of it, and also, hungry and desperate civilians who are trying to grab the aid and take as much as they can, which means that they end up stealing some of it, looting some of it, while it’s still on the way. Right. So it’s lawlessness and effectively social order breakdown. I mean, this is kind of the downstream effects of extended war in a particular place. There’s a power vacuum. That situation can be very difficult for an organization like the United Nations to be able to operate safely. Right. The few aid trucks that do come in have had to either suspend their aid deliveries into the North or have not been able to deliver aid there. The last time UNRWA, the UN agency in charge of Palestinian refugees, tried to bring trucks to the North was nearly a month ago. But they said that one of their convoys came under fire. Another major aid provider, the World Food Program, said that they haven’t delivered aid there in over three weeks. They cited all of the reasons we talked about for this suspension. So while aid hasn’t been coming into the North, people have been growing more desperate and hungry and the situation there has been getting worse, which has been raising international alarm. There’s been increased calls on Israel to let aid go through to the North and to alleviate the suffering of the residents there. So Israel partnered with these local Palestinian businessmen in Gaza, and they promised to secure the aid convoys that the businessmen would supply and that would make their way into the North. They successfully did this three times last week. So people started being very hopeful that more would come, and ahead of the fourth delivery, they started to gather at this distribution point right outside of Gaza City in the North. That brings us to Thursday’s incident. [MUSIC PLAYING] So last Thursday around 4:45 AM, around 38 aid trucks reached this distribution point. They start getting closer to the crowds of people who had camped there overnight waiting for this aid to come. When the people see the trucks coming, they’re very desperate. They surround them. They get on top of them. Then at some point, Israeli soldiers start firing shots. Then it turned violent very fast. It ended with 118 Palestinians dead and 760 injured.

"Only a Trickle of Aid Reaches Northern Gaza, as Hunger Worsens",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/04/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-trucks.html,2024-03-04T17:50:35+0000,"A small number of trucks carrying desperately needed food headed for Gaza City, but at least some were swarmed and looted by people along the way.","Only a trickle of aid managed on Monday to reach the desperately hungry people of the northern Gaza Strip, where the United Nations has warned that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians face a growing threat of famine after nearly five months of fighting and blockade.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement A small number of trucks carrying desperately needed food headed for Gaza City, but at least some were swarmed and looted by people along the way. ByAaron BoxermanandAdam Rasgon reporting from Jerusalem Only a trickle of aid managed on Monday to reach the desperately hungry people of the northern Gaza Strip, where the United Nations has warned that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians face a growing threat of famine after nearly five months of fighting and blockade. Fifteen trucks were dispatched overnight to northern Gaza as part of a relief effort involving Palestinian businessmen, according to COGAT, the Israeli military body that regulates aid to the Palestinians. But at least five of those were looted along the way, according to an Israeli official who was not authorized to comment publicly, and so spoke on condition of anonymity. It was unclear exactly how many of the trucks reached their intended destination, Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighborhood. Izzat Aqel, a Palestinian businessman involved in the operation, said he aimed to send an additional 30 trucks with food relief to northern Gaza on Monday night. Aid officials have warned that Palestinians in Gaza could be on the brink of famine unless relief is substantially stepped up, with over 500,000 people already facing a dire lack of food. One in six children under the age of 2 in Gaza is acutely malnourished, according to the United Nations. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said visits to hospitals in the north by agency officials — the first since early October — found severe levels of malnutrition and “children dying of starvation.” The dire conditions have prompted crowds of desperate people to swarm aid trucks and contributed to a bloody scene last week, when Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinians who had gathered en masse around a convoy of trucks that had entered northern Gaza. Over 100 Palestinians were killed, many by gunfire, according to Palestinian health officials. The Israeli military said the troops had fired on members of the crowd who approached them in a threatening manner and attributed most of the deaths to a stampede around the convoy. In the wake of the bloodshed at the convoy, Israel has faced even greater international pressure to facilitate more aid for Gazans, particularly in the north.

ByMichael D. Shear,Zolan Kanno-YoungsandErica L. Green Reporting from Washington Vice President Kamala Harris, who has emerged as one of the leading voices for Palestinians in closed-door meetings, pressed for a pause in fighting in Gaza with a member of Israel’s war cabinet, Benny Gantz, at the White House on Monday afternoon, according to the White House. The vice president emphasized the urgency of securing a hostage deal and reducing the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded alongside Israel’s war against Hamas in response to attacks on Oct. 7. She praised Israel’s “constructive approach” to seeking a six-week cease-fire but urged the government to do more to allow desperately needed humanitarian aid to reach those in need in Gaza. “The vice president expressed her deep concern about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza and the recent horrific tragedy around an aid convoy in northern Gaza,” a White House description of the meeting said. It added that “she urged Israel to take additional measures in cooperation with the United States and international partners to increase the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza.” The meeting came as the United States said it would continueairdrops of foodthat began on Saturday in an effort to confront what humanitarian groups say is a crisis for the more than one million displaced Palestinians in Rafah, in southern Gaza, as Israel prepares to deploy ground forces there. Although Ms. Harris has not strayed too far from President Biden’s war message, in a speech on Sunday she took a tougher tone in demanding an “immediate cease-fire.” Still, she directed her remarks at Hamas, not Israel’s leadership, and repeated that she and the president remained “unwavering in our commitment to Israel’s security.” In meetings at the White House, she has been forceful in urging the administration not to dismiss the anger from Palestinian Americans and others in the United States, who contend that Mr. Biden has not done enough to prevent the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians in Gaza, according to four people familiar with the matter.

Palestinian Authority’s Government Submits Resignation as U.S. Calls for Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/world/middleeast/palestinian-authority-government-pm-resigns.html,2024-02-26T14:06:10+0000,It was not clear whether the appointment of a new prime minister and cabinet would be enough to revamp the authority or persuade Israel to let it govern Gaza after the war there ends.,"Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh of the Palestinian Authority, the body that administers part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, tendered the resignation of his cabinet on Monday, according to the authority’s official news agency.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement It was not clear whether the appointment of a new prime minister and cabinet would be enough to revamp the authority or persuade Israel to let it govern Gaza after the war there ends. ByPatrick Kingsley Reporting from Jerusalem Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh of the Palestinian Authority, the body that administers part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, tendered the resignation of his cabinet on Monday, according to the authority’s official news agency. The decision follows diplomatic efforts involving the United States and Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, to persuade the authority to overhaul itself in a way that would enable it to take over the administration of Gaza after the war there ends. But it was unclear whether Mr. Shtayyeh’s resignation would be enough to revamp the authority or persuade Israel to let it govern Gaza. President Mahmoud Abbas, the most senior leader of the authority, will stay in position along with his security chiefs. And after accepting Mr. Shtayyeh’s resignation, Mr. Abbas asked him to remain as a caretaker prime minister while a replacement is sought. Israeli leaders had strongly hinted that they would not allow the authority’s existing leadership to run Gaza. American and Arab leaders had hoped that new leadership might make Israel more likely to cede administrative control of Gaza to the authority — a context that Mr. Shtayyeh discussed in his resignation statement. “The next stage and its challenges require new governmental and political arrangements that take into account the emerging reality in the Gaza Strip,” Mr. Shtayyeh wrote, according to Wafa, the authority’s news agency. Those challenges include the push for “the extension of the Palestinian Authority’s sovereignty over the entire land of Palestine,” he added. With no functional parliament within the areas controlled by the authority, Mr. Abbas remains the key figure in the authority, regardless of Mr. Shtayyeh’s fate. Mr. Abbas has long ruled by decree, and he exerts wide influence over the judiciary and prosecution system. Any prime minister works under the authority of Mr. Abbas and has little leeway to make their own decisions. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Harris Calls for an ‘Immediate Cease-Fire’ in Gaza,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/03/world/middleeast/kamala-harris-cease-fire.html,2024-03-04T00:25:13+0000,The vice president urged Hamas to agree to a six-week cease-fire proposal and called on Israel to increase the flow of aid into the enclave.,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday called for an “immediate cease-fire” in Gaza, saying that Hamas should agree to the six-week pause currently on the table and that Israel should increase the flow of aid into the besieged enclave amid a humanitarian crisis.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement The vice president urged Hamas to agree to a six-week cease-fire proposal and called on Israel to increase the flow of aid into the enclave. transcript Hamas claims it wants a cease-fire. Well, there is a deal on the table. And as we have said, Hamas needs to agree to that deal. Let’s get a cease-fire. Let’s reunite the hostages with their families, and let’s provide immediate relief to the people of Gaza. And given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate cease-fire, for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table. ByErica L. Green Reporting from Selma, Ala. Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday called for an “immediatecease-fire” in Gaza, saying that Hamas should agree to the six-week pause currently on the table and that Israel should increase the flow of aid into the besieged enclave amid a humanitarian crisis. Ms. Harris’s remarks, delivered in Selma, Ala., bolstered a recent push by President Joe Biden for an agreement and came a day before she was to meet with a top Israeli cabinet official involved in war planning, Benny Gantz. Her tone echoed a sharper and more urgent tone coming from the White House as its frustration with Israel grows. Last month, the president called Israel’s response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack “over the top.” Ms. Harris assailed the dire conditions in Gaza, calling the situation a “humanitarian catastrophe.” It was her most forceful assessment to date of the Middle East conflict, which has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan health authorities, and put the enclave on the brink of famine. “What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating,” Ms. Harris said. “We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed. Women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care. And children dying from malnutrition and dehydration. As I have said many times, too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.” “The threat Hamas poses to the people of Israel must be eliminated,” Ms. Harris added. “And given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate cease-fire, for at least the next six weeks.” Mr. Biden has been pushing for a deal between Hamas and Israel that would allow for the release of hostages and a temporary cease-fire by Ramadan, the Muslim holy month that starts around March 10. U.S. officials said that Israel had “more or less accepted” terms of the deal, but Hamas has yet to agree to it. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByAdam RasgonandHiba Yazbek Adam Rasgon reported from Jerusalem and Hiba Yazbek from Amman, Jordan Days after an aid delivery in Gaza turned into a deadly disaster, Israel pushed ahead with another convoy bound for northern Gaza on Sunday, a Palestinian businessman involved in the initiative said, as the United Nations warned that deaths of children and infants are likely to “rapidly increase” if food and medical supplies are not delivered immediately. Izzat Aqel, the businessman, said the renewed aid delivery effort on Sunday came after only one of at least 16 trucks carrying supplies to the north a day earlier made it to Gaza City. The rest, he said, had been surrounded by desperate Gazans and emptied in the Nuseirat neighborhood in central Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for coordinating aid deliveries into Gaza, said on X on Sunday that 277 trucks entered Gaza, what the agency said was the highest number of trucks to enter the enclave in a single day since the start of the war. It was unclear how many of those trucks reached northern Gaza. Delivering supplies into Gaza, especially the north, has taken on increased urgency in recent days as the United Nations has warned that many Gazans are on the edge of famine. Israeli officials have worked in recent days with multiple Gazan businessmen to organize private aid convoys. But a convoy that arrived in Gaza City before dawn on Thursday ended in devastation.More than 100 Palestinians were killedafter many thousands of people massed around trucks laden with food and supplies, Gazan health officials said. Israeli and Palestinian officials and witnessesoffered sharply divergent accountsof the chaos. Witnesses described extensive shooting by Israeli forces, and doctors at Gaza hospitals said most of the casualties were from gunfire. The Israeli military said most of the victims were trampled in a crush of people trying to seize the cargo, although Israeli officials acknowledged that troops had opened fire at members of the crowd who, the army said, had approached “in a manner that endangered them.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMonika PronczukandPatrick Kingsley To report this article, The New York Times reviewed a leaked U.N. investigation, interviewed released detainees and spoke to lawyers who are researching conditions in Israeli detention facilities. An unpublished investigation by the main United Nations agency for Palestinian affairs accuses Israel of abusing hundreds of Gazans captured during the war with Hamas, according to a copy of the report reviewed by The New York Times. The report was compiled by UNRWA, the U.N. agency that is itself at the center of an investigation after accusations that at least 30 of its 13,000 employees participated in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. The authors of the report allege that the detainees, including at least 1,000 civilians later released without charge, were held at three military sites inside Israel. The report said the detainees included males and females whose ages ranged from 6 to 82. Some, the report said, died in detention. The document includes accounts from detainees who said they were beaten, stripped, robbed, blindfolded, sexually abused and denied access to lawyers and doctors, often for more than a month. The draft document describes “a range of ill-treatment that Gazans of all ages, abilities and backgrounds have reported facing in makeshift detention facilities in Israel.” Such treatment, the report concluded, “was used to extract information or confessions, to intimidate and humiliate, and to punish.” The report is based on interviews with more than 100 of the 1,002 detainees who were released back to Gaza by mid-February. The document estimates that 3,000 other Gazans remain in Israeli detention without access to lawyers. Its findings echo those of severalIsraeliandPalestinianrights groups, as well as separate investigations by twoU.N. special rapporteurs, all of whom allege similar abuses inside Israeli detention centers.

ByVivian YeeandAaron Boxerman The main United Nations aid agency that serves Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and elsewhere in the region has “reached a breaking point,” its leader has warned, as donors have pulled funding from the agency and Israel imposed further restrictions on its operations and called for its closure. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, the chief lifeline for Gaza’s besieged population of 2.2 million people through the Israel-Hamas war, haslost $450 million in donor funding, including from the United States, sinceIsraeli allegations that 12 of the agency’s employeeswere involved in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack. Absent new funding, UNRWA, the largest aid agency on the ground in Gaza, says that its reserves will be gone by March, even as aid groups warn that Gaza is on the verge of famine. “I fear we are on the edge of a monumental disaster with grave implications for regional peace, security and human rights,” Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA’s commissioner general, wrote in a letter to the president of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday. Fewer aid trucks have entered Gaza this week than earlier in the year, when between 100 and 200 aid trucks were arriving on most days; both border crossings used for aid have frequently closed, sometimes because Israeli protesters have blocked a crossing. A total of 69 trucks entered on Tuesday and Wednesday, the agency said. It added that it is aiming for 500 per day to meet Gaza’s needs. The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to take immediate steps to facilitate the aid Gazadesperately needs, which UNRWA would normally play a central role in distributing. But Israeli officials have argued that its employees’ alleged links to Hamas fundamentally compromise the agency. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByErica L. GreenandAaron Boxerman Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to meet with Benny Gantz,a member of the Israeli war cabinet, in Washington on Monday,according to a White House official and a spokesman for Mr. Gantz. During the meeting with Mr. Gantz, Ms. Harris is expected to discuss the urgency of securing a hostage deal, which would allow for a temporary cease-fire, and the need to significantly increase aid into Gaza, according to the White House official, who provided details on the condition of anonymity. The meeting, which is scheduled to take place at the White House, comes as the Biden administration faces pressure to help secure a temporary cease-fire and hostage deal in the Israel-Hamas war and to more forcefully address the escalating humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. On Saturday, another senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic efforts, told reporters that negotiations were continuing, and that Israel had “more or less accepted” a framework for the deal and that the ball was now in Hamas’s court. The proposal could lead to a six-week pause in the fighting, as well as the release of some of the hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israel. President Biden had expressed hope that a deal could be reached by Monday as U.S. officials said they were working to secure a deal by the start of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month that will start this year around March 10. The United States also delivered its firstairdrop of food into Gaza on Saturdayamid warnings that the besieged enclavewas on the brink of famine. Israel has imposed tight restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid, even as international relief organizations have suspended some convoys because of rising anarchy and the looting of some aid trucks inside Gaza.

At least two health care workers, including a paramedic, were among those killed after the strike near the gate of the Emirati maternity hospital, the health ministry said. Photos taken by news agencies showed colleagues of the paramedic, whom the health ministry identified as Abdul Fattah Abu Marai, taking his body to the nearby Kuwaiti hospital, as well as injured children lying on stretchers, as other children looked on and cried. The Israeli military said later Saturday that, with help from Israel’s domestic security agency, it had carried out a “precision strike” against “Islamic Jihad terrorists” near the hospital. The military declined to respond to reports that the strike had injured children. The Israeli military had previously declared that Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city, would be a safe zone for civilians, and more than half of the enclave’s entire population is now crammed into it, with many living in makeshift tents over nearly every inch of available space. Butairstrikes on Rafahhave continued even as the number of people sheltering there has swelled to around 1.5 million. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel hasvowed that his forces will invade the citywhether or not a temporary cease-fire deal is reached, despite dire warnings from humanitarian groups and many of Israel’s allies that any military operation in Rafah would have catastrophic consequences for civilians. The news of Saturday’s strike was “outrageous and unspeakable,” the leader of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,said on social media, reiterating calls for a cease-fire and for the protection of health care workers and civilians. The victims of the strike were sheltering near the Emirati maternity hospital, one of the last hospitals still functioning in Gaza. Despite having only five beds remaining for women giving birth, the hospital is managing more than half of the estimated 180 births happening daily in the enclave, said Dominic Allen, the State of Palestine representative for the United Nations Population Fund, a sexual and reproductive health agency known as U.N.F.P.A. The Emirati hospital is essentially “the last hope for pregnant women in the whole of Gaza,” Mr. Allen said. A strike so close to the hospital poses a “terrifying” risk to pregnant women, newborns and the overloaded health care workers trying to care for them, he added.

ByAaron Boxerman,Adam RasgonandAndy Newman The Gaza aid convoy that ended in bloodshed this weekwas organized by Israel itselfas part of a newly hatched partnership with local Palestinian businessmen, according to Israeli officials, Palestinian businessmen and Western diplomats. Israel has been involved in at least four such aid convoys to northern Gaza over the past week. It undertook the effort, Israeli officials told two Western diplomats, to fill a void in assistance to northern Gaza, where famine looms as international aid groups have suspended most operations, citing Israeli refusals to greenlight aid trucks and rising lawlessness. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter. Israeli officials reached out to multiple Gazan businessmen and asked them to help organize private aid convoys to the north, two of the businessmen said, while Israel would provide security. TheUnited Nations has warnedthat more than 570,000 Gazans — particularly in northern Gaza — are facing “catastrophic levels of deprivation and starvation” after nearly five months of war and an almost complete Israeli blockade of the territory following the Oct. 7 attacks led by Hamas. Some residents have resorted to raiding the pantries of neighbors who fled their homes, while others have been grinding up animal feed for flour. U.N. aid convoys carrying essential goods to northern Gaza have been looted — either by civilians fearing starvation or organized gangs — amid the anarchy that has followed Israel’s ground invasion. “My family, friends, and neighbors are dying from hunger,” said Jawdat Khoudary, a Palestinian businessman who helped organize some of the trucks involved in the Israeli relief initiative.

A U.S. official said it was the beginning of a broader campaign. ByMichael Crowley Reporting from Washington The United States made its first airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza on Saturday, as the Biden administration tried to prevent a greater humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territory. Three U.S. Air Force cargo planes airdropped 38,000 ready-to-eat meals, in a joint operation with the Jordanian Air Force, U.S. Central Command said in a statement on Saturday. The airdrops, which some aid experts criticized as insufficient and largely symbolic, contribute “to ongoing U.S. government efforts to provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance to the people in Gaza,” the statement said. “We are conducting planning for potential follow-on airborne aid delivery missions.” One of the U.S. officials briefing reporters on the operation on Saturday said that 66 pallets had been dropped over Gaza. The official said that drop sites had been chosen in relatively safe areas where people are sheltering and in need. The U.S. did not coordinate its operation with Hamas or any other group on the ground, the official said. The operation was intended to be the first in a sustained campaign of airdrops, the official said, adding that the United States is also exploring other avenues of bringing more aid into Gaza, including by sea. The official and others at the briefing spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations and diplomatic efforts. The drops came a day after President Biden said the United States would find new ways to get aid to Palestinians in desperate need because of Israel’s five-month military campaign to destroy Hamas. It also comes two days aftermore than 100 Palestinians were killedas Israeli forces opened fire around a convoy of aid trucks in northern Gaza. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

BySteven Erlanger Photographs bySergey Ponomarev Steven Erlanger traveled to Homesh, Silat Ad-Dhahr, Al Fandaqumiya and Shavei Shomron in the West Bank to report this article. For an Israeli settlement that has become such a resounding symbol of religious and right-wing politics in the West Bank, Homesh is not much to look at. Three families live in tarpaulin-covered shelters full of bunk beds for some 50 young men, who study in a yeshiva that is a shabby prefab structure surrounded by abandoned toys, building materials and garbage. They live part time here amid the ruins and rubbish of a hilltopsettlement ripped down in 2005by the Israeli Army and the police. It is one of four West Bank settlements dismantled when Israel pulled all of its troops and settlements out of Gaza. Israel’s intention then, pushed by Washington, was to signal that outlying settlements too hard to defend would be consolidated in any future peace deal. The decision to dismantle them is now being challenged by the more religious and right-wing ministers in the government of Benjamin Netanyahu. They are agitating to settle more land in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and even remove Palestinians from Gaza to resettle there. Homesh, perched in the hills above Nablus, has become a symbol of their resolve. Early last year, the Israeli government decidedto relegalize Homesh, but the Supreme Court then required the government to dismantle it once more and ensure that Palestinians who own the land on which it sits can reach it safely.

ByGaya Gupta Nearly 60 leaders from international and regional news outletssigned a letteron Thursday and Friday committing their support for journalists covering the war in Gaza and calling for their safety and the freedom to do their work amid intense personal risk. The letter, coordinated by the Committee to Protect Journalists with the support of the World Association of News Publishers, also called on Israeli authorities to protect journalists as noncombatants, as required by international law, adding that those responsible for violations of that protection should be held accountable. “These journalists — on whom the international news media and the international community rely for information about the situation inside Gaza — continue to report despite grave personal risk,” the letter says of the Palestinian media workers doing the on-the-ground reporting. “They continue despite the loss of family, friends and colleagues, the destruction of homes and offices, constant displacement, communications blackouts and shortages of food and fuel.” The signatories include leaders of The Associated Press, Reuters, The New York Times and regional outlets across Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Palestinian journalists have faced grave risks or personal loss while trying to report on the war: Some have been injured while reporting; others have lost family members and colleagues. Several have quit amid the challenges. Since Oct. 7, at least 94 journalists have been killed in the war, making it the deadliest period for journalists since the Committee to Protect Journalists started collecting data in 1992, according to the organization. Israeli and Egyptian authorities have prohibited international media from entering Gaza, and journalists from other major news outlets have evacuated, making the true scale of the warimpossibleto grasp. According to data from the Committee to Protect Journalists, most of the media workers killed in the war were Palestinian, and many of them were killed along with their families in airstrikes. Some human rights groups have said that Israel has targeted journalists, though Israel has repeatedly denied that accusation. The letter prompted backlash from somejournalistswho said they or their colleagues were punished by their news organizations for affirming their support for Palestinian journalists and civilians in letters highly critical of Israel’s war tactics in Gaza. When journalists haveresignedorbeen firedfor protesting the Israel-Hamas war, news organizations have said that voicing opinions that take sides violates their newsroom policies.

What they encountered was death and injury by the hundreds, according to witnesses and a doctor who treated the wounded, as Israeli forces opened fire toward desperate Palestinians who surged forward when aid trucks finally arrived before dawn on Thursday. “I saw things I never, ever thought I would see,” said Mohammed Al-Sholi, who had camped out overnight for a chance to get food for his family. “I saw people falling to the ground after being shot, and others simply took the food items that were with them and continued running for their lives.” Amid the chaos and bloodshed, some people were run over by the aid trucks, he said. On Friday, President Biden said the United States would begin airdropping aid to Gaza to help relieve the suffering there, as European leaders condemned Israel for the deaths of scores of hungry Palestinians who were killed as they surrounded the aid convoy. The Gazan health authorities have said that Israeli troops killed more than 100 people and wounded 700 others in a “massacre” as the convoy rolled along a dark road, a version of events that Israel disputed. An Israeli military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said on Thursday that Israeli soldiers had been trying to secure the convoy and fired “when the mob moved in a manner that endangered them.” But he said the soldiers had not fired on people seeking aid.

ByJulian E. BarnesandZolan Kanno-Youngs Reporting from Washington President Biden said on Friday that the United States would begin airdropping humanitarian relief supplies into Gaza, a decision prompted bythe dozens of Palestinians who were killed as Israeli forces opened firenear an aid convoy in Gaza City a day earlier. “Innocent people got caught in a terrible war unable to feed their families, and you saw the response when they tried to get aid in,” Mr. Biden said before meeting with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy. “And we need to do more, and the United States will do more.” Mr. Biden said that the United States would work with Jordan, which has been at the forefront of airdrop efforts to Gaza, as well as other allies to deliver aid by air and that supplies could, eventually, also be delivered by sea. “Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough now,” Mr. Biden said. “Innocent lives are on the line, and children’s lives are on the line.” Mr. Biden and Ms. Meloni discussed efforts to prevent the war in Gaza from becoming a larger conflict, as well as support for Ukraine and steps to address human trafficking and global migration. John F. Kirby, a senior National Security Council official, said that the first airdrops would focus on food, followed by water and medicine. A U.S. military official said the Air Force plans to drop 50,000 meal rations. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Trump has said noticeably little about the subject. He criticizedPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, before quickly retreating to more standard expressions of support for the country. And he has made blustery claims that the invasion never would have happened had he been president. But his overall approach has been laissez-faire. “So you have a war that’s going on, and you’re probably going to have to let this play out. You’re probably going to have to let it play out, because a lot of people are dying,” Mr. Trump said in aninterviewwith Univision a month after the attack. His main advice to Mr. Netanyahu and the Israelis, he said then, was to do a better job with “public relations,” because the Palestinians were “beating them at the public relations front.” Mr. Trump’s hands-off approach to the bloody Middle East conflict reflects the profound anti-interventionist shift he has brought about in the Republican Party over the past eight years and has been colored by his feelings about Mr. Netanyahu, whomhe may never forgiveforcongratulating President Biden for his 2020 victory. Mr. Trump has offered no substantive criticisms of Mr. Biden’s response to the Hamas invasion and Israel’s retaliation in Gaza. Instead, he has pinned the blame for the entire crisis on Mr. Biden’s “weakness,” in the same way he often does when violence or tragedy occurs. “You would have never had the problem that you just had, the horrible problem where Israel — Oct. 7, where Israel was so horribly attacked,” the former president told a crowd in Rock Hill, S.C., on Feb. 23, before switching to more practiced attack lines against Mr. Biden.

College Dorm Decorations Become a Front in the Campus Free Speech Wars,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/01/nyregion/campus-free-speech-barnard-columbia.html,2024-03-01T08:00:52+0000,Barnard College is requiring students to strip decorations from their dorm doors in the wake of protests over the Israel-Hamas war.,Dorm door decorations are emerging as the next battleground in the fight over academic freedom and free speech at Barnard College.,"Advertisement Supported by Barnard College is requiring students to strip decorations from their dorm doors in the wake of protests over the Israel-Hamas war. BySharon Otterman Dorm door decorations are emerging as the next battleground in the fight over academic freedom and free speech at Barnard College. As at many schools, Barnard students often use their dorm doors to display a bit of personality. A walk around the freshman dorms early this week found sorority pledge signs, Lunar New Year decorations and a pinned-up loose-leaf paper asking: “Who’s your celebrity crush?” But students had also posted stickers and slogans supporting the Palestinian cause and naming the war in Gaza as a genocide. “Zionism is terrorism,” one student’s door sticker said. Concerned that some students might feel intimidated by such messages, the Barnard administration has decided to enforce a ban on dorm door decorations altogether. Their removal was set to begin on Thursday, and all but “official items placed by the college” will be taken down, Leslie Grinage, the dean of the college, wrote in an email to students. “While many decorations and fixtures on doors serve as a means of helpful communication amongst peers, we are also aware that some may have the unintended effect of isolating those who have different views and beliefs,” she wrote. Barnard has made aseries of movesto limit the spaces where students and faculty can express themselves publicly since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. The moves are crafted broadly, but they come as Barnard and other campuses face controversy and litigation over pro-Palestinian speech that some believe is antisemitic.

It is clear that Israel’s illegal occupation is also being administered in breach of the prohibition of the crime of apartheid. It is indistinguishable from settler colonialism, which has no place in the 21st century. ByMarlise Simons Reporting from Paris At a hearing before the U.N.’s highest court, South Africa on Tuesday called Israel’s policies toward Palestinians an “extreme form of apartheid” and argued that its occupation of territory sought for an eventual Palestinian state was “fundamentally illegal.” The hearing at the International Court of Justice in The Hague is one of two matters being heard about Israel, part of a concerted effort to leverage the authority of the court and the global reach of the U.N. to stop the war in Gaza and examine the legality of Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians. Starting this week and lasting six days, the court is hearing arguments on Israel’s conduct, following a request by the United Nations General Assembly more than a year ago. In the other matter, a case, which began in January, South Africa accuses Israel of committing genocide in its ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected those accusations. The latest proceedings, which began on Monday, focus on the legality of Israel’s “occupation, settlement and annexation” of Palestinian-majority territories, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem. South Africa and many other countries that have asked to address the court argue that Israel’s decades-long occupation violates the Palestinians’ right to self-determination and that its security apparatus, including a giant wall, amounts to racial segregation. More than 50 countries and three regional blocs are scheduled to argue before the 15-judge bench over the next week, a level of participation never before seen at the court. The hearings on Israel’s policies have gained urgency amid the bloodshed of the war in Gaza. They come less than a month afterthe court ordered Israelto restrain its attacks in the Hamas-controlled territory in the genocide case. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByHiba YazbekandAaron Boxerman Israeli forces opened fire on Thursday as a crowd gathered near a convoy of aid trucks in Gaza City in a chaotic scene in which scores were killed and injured, according to Gazan officials and the Israeli military, which attributed most of the deaths to a stampede. Although officials from both sides offered differing accounts, the deaths of so many people who were surrounding a convoy carrying food in a part of Gaza where starvation is rampant reflected the desperation and spiraling lawlessness in the territory following Israel’s ground invasion and threatened to derail ongoing cease-fire talks. The Gazan health ministry said in a statement that Israeli forces had killed more than 100 people and had injured 700 others in a “massacre,” as they waited for food from the convoy. The latest bloodshed came as Gaza’s health officials reported that the death toll from the war had risen above 30,000, a grim milestone that intensified pressure on Israel to end its military offensive. transcript Thousands of desperately hungry civilians in northern Gaza gathered on the street before dawn on Thursday, hoping to find food on a humanitarian convoy. Instead, hundreds were killed and injured trying to get aid from the trucks, according to Gazan health officials. Local hospital staff said scores were killed or wounded by gunfire. The Israel Defense Forces claim that most of the victims were trampled or run over by vehicles, and that their soldiers only fired at a group of people who were threatening their forces. Israeli officials declined to provide unedited footage of the incident. The fragments of drone footage they released only add to the confusion around the series of events that killed and wounded so many Gazans. I.D.F. footage shows hundreds of civilians surrounding aid trucks on the coastal Al-Rashid Road in Gaza City. Throngs of people crowd around each truck, hoping to catch bags of food as they are tossed off the back. At one point, people in the crowd suddenly appear to panic and run in multiple directions. The I.D.F. says that this footage shows a mass stampede where Gazans are trampled, but the quality and short length of the clips makes it difficult to confirm these claims. Another clip in the I.D.F. footage shows two Israeli tanks a quarter-mile down the road and at least a dozen bodies lying nearby. The video doesn’t show the events that caused the casualties, but several people can be seen crawling and ducking for cover. Other video, filmed from a side street by an Al Jazeera camera crew, helps fill in some of the gaps about what unfolded on the ground. It captures shots fired as crowds of people scatter and take cover. It is not clear when this footage was filmed in relation to the I.D.F. drone video, but what is clearly visible is tracer ammunition, a specialized type of projectile that ignites to illuminate its path, which helps troops fine-tune their targeting. The source of the fire is not captured in the footage, but the trajectory shows it’s coming from the direction where Israeli military vehicles are positioned, just a half-mile away. An Israeli military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said that Israeli soldiers fired warning shots in the air before firing “only in face of danger when the mob moved in a manner which endangered them.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByAdam Sella A shooting at a gas station outside a settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Thursday afternoon left two Israeli men dead, according to Israeli officials, who said the gunman was also killed. Avraham Applebaum, a medic for Israel’s emergency medical services, said that when he arrived at the gas station outside the Israeli settlement of Eli, he saw “one injured person with many bullet wounds in a car and another lying” on the ground. “We did what we could,” Mr. Applebaum said, but the wounds were too serious. Shortly thereafter, the two men, aged 20 and 40, were declared dead by the emergency service. Israel’s military called the attacker a “terrorist,” adding that after he opened fire on the gas station, he was killed. Israeli media reports said he was killed by a civilian who had returned from reserve duty in Gaza. Four civilians were killed at the same gas station in Eli last June in a shooting attack claimed by Hamas. Last week, a shooting attack near a checkpoint in the occupied West Bankkilled one and injured severalothers. Since Hamas’s attack on Oct. 7 and the start of Israel’s campaign in Gaza, violence and Israeli military raids have escalated in the West Bank, as haveunauthorized moves by Jewish settlersin the occupied territory. Palestinian militias have carried out shooting attacks against Israelis; frequent Israeli military raids have arrested thousands and have often turned deadly; and extremist Jewish settlers have rampaged through Palestinian villages, setting fire to property.

ByVictoria Kim The death toll in Gaza passed a somber milestone on Thursday as the local health ministry reported that more than 30,000 people had been killed in the war since Oct. 7. The number of deaths since Israel launched its military offensive against Hamas in Gaza had already surpassed the tolls of any previous Arab conflict with Israel when it rose above 20,000 in December. Many experts say the official toll is very likely an undercount, given the difficulty of accurately tallying deaths amid unrelenting fighting, communications disruptions, a collapsing medical system and people still believed to be under rubble. Still, the reported figure is staggering — roughly one person killed for every 73 Palestinians in Gaza, whose population is about 2.2 million. The figures provided by the Gazan health ministry do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Many international observers have said they believe that the ministry’s overall toll is reliable, while the proportion of Hamas-affiliated fighters among those killed remains unclear. Anarticlepublished in November in the British medical journal The Lancet said that an analysis of the first weeks of mortality reports from the health ministry “suggested reasonable data quality” and that the deaths were “among Gazan population groups that are likely to be largely civilian.” Israel has come under growing international pressure to stop its offensive, and even President Biden, its strongest ally, has expressed growing frustration with the rising death toll and worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But Israeli leaders have insisted that they will continue fighting in order to eliminate Hamas, the armed group that led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel in which officials say at least 1,200 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage, setting off the war. U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators are working to broker a cease-fire and the release of hostages, but the prospects of that remain murky. On Wednesday, Hamas’s political leadersaid in a televised speechthat while the group was open to making a deal with Israel, it was also ready to continue fighting. He called on Palestinians to march to the Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem in March, raising the prospect of fresh clashes with Israeli security forces around a site holy to both Muslims and Jews. In addition to bearing the risk of being killed in strikes or fighting, Palestinians are living with the growing specter of famine and disease. The health ministry has said infants have died from dehydration and malnutrition in recent days. A physician who was in Gaza in late Januarytold CBS’s “60 Minutes”this week that people were dying “in a fully treatable situation” because of the lack of basic medical supplies. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said on Thursday in a social media postmarking the30,000 deaths that most of those killed in Gaza were women and children. “This horrific violence and suffering must end,” he wrote. “Cease-fire.” Victoria Kimis a correspondent based in Seoul, focused on international breaking news coverage.More about Victoria Kim Advertisement",The New York Times

ByNicholas Bogel-BurroughsandColbi Edmonds Dressed in his U.S. Air Force uniform, Aaron Bushnell walked up to the Israeli embassy in Washington one afternoon this week andcalmly described his intentionto “engage in an extreme act of protest” against Israel’s military offensive in Gaza. He proceeded to pour a flammable liquid over his buzz-cut head, pulled his camouflage cap tightly over his forehead and lit himself on fire. “Free Palestine!” he shouted several times before collapsing onto the cement. In the days since his stunning act, which Mr. Bushnell captured on a livestream, friends and relatives have been trying to understand how a young man they once knew as a shy, thoughtful boy in an isolated Christian community in Massachusetts, who went on to become a senior airman working on cyberdefense in Texas, came to mount such a final, fatal protest. “It’s hard to wrap my head around,” said Ashley Schuman, 26, who has known Mr. Bushnell since childhood. “I’m just like, ‘How? How did you get here?’” Mr. Bushnell’s self-immolation has spurred a flurry of vigils in his honor, prompted new protests against Israel’s attacks and led to criticism from some who viewed the protest as a suicidal act that should not be celebrated. His was the second such protest in the United States in recent months. In December, a woman with a Palestinian flaglit herself on fire outside of the Israeli consulatebuilding in Atlanta; she was not identified, and she has remained hospitalized, currently listed in stable condition. On Wednesday, Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, asked the Defense Department whether Mr. Bushnell had ever shown any “extremist leanings” in the past.

ByMarlise Simons Reporting from Paris The International Court of Justice began hearing arguments on Monday on the legality of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories. It is the first time the world’s highest court has been asked to give an advisory opinion on the issue, which has been the subject of years of debates and resolutions at the United Nations. The hearings at the Peace Palace in The Hague are focusing on decades of Israeli actions in the Palestinian territories, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem. But the arguments have gained urgency amid the deadliest-ever Israeli-Palestinian war, in Gaza, and less than a month afterthe court ordered Israelin a separate case to restrain its attacks in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority’s foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, opened the proceedings by telling the court that Israel had subjected Palestinians to decades of discrimination, leaving them with the choice of “displacement, subjugation or death.” Israel is not scheduled to appear at the hearings, but it has filed a written submission rejecting the validity of the proceedings. Here is what to know. The I.C.J., based in The Hague, was established by the U.N. Charter in 1945 to rule on issues of international law and settle disputes among nations. Only states can bring cases before the court. All countries belonging to the United Nations are automatically members of the court and are expected to accept its jurisdiction. The court has long had a low profile, often dealing with staid issues such as border disputes. But more recently it has been drawn into pressing conflicts, notably between Ukraine and Russia and Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

In a televised speech, Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said the group was open to indirect negotiations with Israel, but that “any flexibility we show in the negotiation process is a commitment to protecting the blood of our people, matched by a readiness to defend them.” He called on Palestinians in Jerusalem and the Israeli-occupied West Bank to march tothe Aqsa mosquewhen the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins around March 10. That creates the prospect of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces around the mosque, one of the holiest sites in Islam and a longtime flashpoint in relations with Israel. Israel hasrestricted access to the Aqsamosque for West Bank Palestinians, and it has severely limited movement within the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza. Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesman, declined on Wednesday to comment on Mr. Haniyeh’s call for a march to the mosque, which is part of a 35-acre site that is also holy for Jews, who call it the Temple Mount. “I would just say, as it pertains to Al Aqsa, we continue to urge Israel to facilitate access to Temple Mount for peaceful worshipers during Ramadan, consistent with past practice and that’ll continue to be our position,” Mr. Miller said.

The literacy rate in the Palestinian territories is among the highest in the world — more than 97 percent — but even in this milieu, Ramallah Friends shined. Founded in 1869 for girls in nearby villages, it had withstood multiple cycles of conflict, periodically serving as a hospital and a refugee center, to become the only international baccalaureate program in the West Bank. Beyond practicing the Quaker tradition of silent reflection, the school was largely nondenominational. It was not uncommon for graduates to attend college abroad and then perhaps work to improve the deteriorating political situation at home: The open landscape outside Ramallah was shrinking as an Israeli settlement visible from campus expanded. It was at school, one day in the third grade, that Hisham and Kinnan met a shy kid on the playground, Tahseen Aliahmad. Tahseen’s mother was from Gaza, and his father was from the West Bank, where he was born as well. He had never traveled to the United States, as Hisham and Kinnan did. But none of this mattered to the boys. “We just kind of picked each other,” Tahseen recalled. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Basem Naim, a Hamas spokesman, said in a text message that the militant group had yet to formally receive “any new proposals” since senior Israeli officials met with Qatari, Egyptian and U.S. mediators in Paris last week to advance a possible deal. Another Hamas official, Ahmad Abdelhadi, said that the group was sticking to its demand that Israel agree to a long-term cease-fire and that leaks about the talks were designed to pressure Hamas to soften its position. “We are not interested in engaging with what’s been floated, because it does not fulfill our demands,” Mr. Abdelhadi said Tuesday in a televised interview with al-Mayadeen, a Lebanese broadcaster. Qatar, a key mediator in the talks, also expressed caution on Tuesday, saying it could not comment on Mr. Biden’s view that negotiators were nearing an agreement. “The efforts are ongoing; all the parties are conducting regular meetings,” Majed al-Ansari, a spokesman for the Qatari foreign ministry, told reporters in Doha. “But for now, while we certainly hope it will be achieved as soon as possible, we don’t have anything in our hands so as to comment on that deadline.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByAlan Rappeport Alan Rappeport writes about economic policy and covers the Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Tuesday that she had personally urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to increase commercial engagement with the West Bank, contending that doing so was important for the economic welfare of both Israelis and Palestinians. Ms. Yellen’s plea was outlined in a letter that she sent to Mr. Netanyahu on Sunday. It represented her most explicit public expression of concern about the economic consequences of the war between Israel and Hamas. In the letter, Ms. Yellen said, she warned about the consequences of the erosion of basic services in the West Bank and called for Israel to reinstate work permits for Palestinians and reduce barriers to commerce within the West Bank. “These actions are vital for the economic well-being of Palestinians and Israelis alike,” Ms. Yellen said at a news conference in Brazil ahead of a gathering of finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations. Ms. Yellen said she told Mr. Netanyahu that she was concerned Israel’s actions were “seriously impairing the West Bank economy, reducing income, and also at the same time having an adverse impact on Israel.” The letter came as the cabinet of the Palestinian Authority, which administers part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank,submitted its resignationon Monday in hopes that it could overhaul itself and potentially take over the administration of Gaza after the war there ends. Negotiations between Israel and Hamas are also resuming in Qatar this week as mediators from that nation, along with the United States and Egypt, work on a deal to release some hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for Israel’s agreeing to a temporary cease-fire. Senior Biden administration officials have been trying to mediate a resolution to the conflict in Gaza, which health authorities there say haskilled approximately 29,000 Palestinians. Ms. Yellen has largely been focused on tracking the economic implications of the war and managing the sanctions that the Treasury Department has imposed on Hamas and those who are involved in its network of finances.

ByIsabel Kershner Reporting from Jerusalem The Israeli government on Sunday approved a resolution rejecting any international attempts to impose a Palestinian state on Israel, saying that Israel would have to directly negotiate any “permanent"" arrangement with the Palestinians. The largely symbolic move followed recent comments from some of Israel’s allies suggesting that they might consider simply recognizing a Palestinian state ahead of any agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who brought the resolution to his cabinet, described its approval as a “declarative decision” that was needed “in light of remarks that have been heard recently in the international community.” The resolution — which bolsters a position Mr. Netanyahu had already staked out several times in recent days — comes as the Biden administration has been trying to brokera deal for the normalization of tiesbetween Israel and Saudi Arabia. U.S. and Saudi officials have said that the prospect of that happening hinges on Israel’s agreeing to work toward a two-state solution — meaning the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Mr. Netanyahu has rebuffed recent pressure from President Biden to agree to that path after the war in Gaza is over and in recent weeksdoubled down on his oppositionto the creation of a Palestinian state. The final wording of the Israeli government resolution appeared to have been carefully crafted with the aim of accommodating both ultranationalist members of Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing government, who oppose the very notion of negotiations with the Palestinians, and the centrists who joined the government to help oversee the war in Gaza after the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7.

ByFarnaz Fassihi,Eric SchmittandJulian E. Barnes Iran has made a concerted effort to rein in militias in Iraq and Syria after the United States retaliated with a series of airstrikes for the killing of three U.S. Army reservists this month. Initially, there were regional concerns that the tit-for-tat violence would lead to an escalation of the Middle East conflict. But since the Feb. 2 U.S. strikes, American officials say, there have been no attacks by Iran-backed militias on American bases in Iraq and only two minor ones in Syria. Before then, the U.S. military logged at least 170 attacks against American troops in four months, Pentagon officials said. The relative quiet reflects decisions by both sides and suggests that Iran does have some level of control over the militias. The Biden administration has made clear thatTehran would be held accountablefor miscalculations and operations by proxy forces, but it has avoided any direct attack on Iran. The U.S. response “may be having some effect,” Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., a retired head of the Pentagon’s Central Command, said in an interview. “The question is are the militias attacking or not,” he added, “and at least for now, they are not.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

How a Slow-Moving Court Became the Center of the World’s Hottest Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/world/middleeast/international-court-justice-israel-palestinians.html,2024-02-26T17:06:39+0000,"The International Court of Justice, the U.N.’s highest judicial body, is in the rare position of weighing in on a closely watched global conflict while hostilities are ongoing.","Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel had many unpredictable consequences, but the elevation of the International Court of Justice to global public attention is a particularly unexpected one.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Subscriber-onlyNewsletter The International Court of Justice, the U.N.’s highest judicial body, is in the rare position of weighing in on a closely watched global conflict while hostilities are ongoing. ByAmanda Taub Reporting from London Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel had many unpredictable consequences, but the elevation of the International Court of Justice to global public attention is a particularly unexpected one. In December, South Africa brought a case against Israelalleging violations of the Genocide Convention, andlast week the court held hearingson a separate matter regarding Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories. The two matters have turned the court into a new arena for the political disputes and legal arguments over Israel’s actions in Gaza, where over 29,000 people have been killed, many byheavy Israeli bombardment. And although the court’s enforcement powers are limited, its public hearings, at a time of intense interest in the conflict, give it considerable power to shape, and reflect, global opinion. The court’s conspicuous role is partly a coincidence of timing: The U.N. General Assembly requested that the court in The Hague issue a nonbinding advisory opinion on the legality of Israel’s occupation back inJanuary 2023. It’s unlikely we’d be discussing those hearings in detail if war had not broken out in the meantime, and if South Africa had not filed its genocide case in the same court. But for now, the court, the U.N.’s highest judicial body, has been thrust into the spotlight and asked to weigh in on a closely watched global conflict while hostilities are ongoing. That has created a highly unusual situation. International court cases often move too slowly to have a real-time effect on current events, and frequently concern dry and arcane subjects such asfishery disputes.

ByMatthew Mpoke BiggandMarlise Simons The United Nations’ top court on Monday heard a final day of arguments on the legality of Israel’s decades-long occupation of Palestinian territories, proceedings that have added pressure to Israel at a time when attention focuses on the war in Gaza. Thehearings, which began last Monday, were the first time that the court, the International Court of Justice, had been asked to detail the legal consequences of Israel’s “prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation” of the territories, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem, since 1967 — issues that have been the subject of years of debate and resolutions at the United Nations. The U.N. General Assembly asked the court to give an advisory opinion. Judge Nawab Salam, the president of the court, ended the hearings saying that the judges’ conclusions would be announced at a public hearing. The conclusions were expected to take at least six months, lawyers at the court said. The sessions, held at the Peace Palace in The Hague, heard from representatives of more than 50 countries, an unusually high number for the court. Most sided with the Palestinian representatives, who argued that Israel had long abused Palestinian rights with impunity and denied their right to self-determination. “Israel has arrogated to itself the right to decide who owns land, who may live on it, how it is used,” Philippe Sands, a member of the Palestinian delegation’s legal team, argued last week. “It has confined Palestinians to enclaves,” he added, and broken up its territory with hundreds of settlements “regarded as a permanent part of Israel.” Israel did not appear at the hearings, but, in a written submission, it rejected the questions raised by the proceedings as biased. The proceedings have been given urgency by Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Health authorities in Gaza say that Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 29,000 people, the majority civilians, and provoked what the United Nations says is a humanitarian disaster. Since the war began, Israeli forces have also detained hundreds of Palestinians in West Bank raids. Deadly violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers has increased and Palestinian attacks on Israelishave also risen. A few speakers at the court, including those from the United States, Britain and Hungary, have sided with Israel. On Wednesday, a State Department official argued before the court that Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians were determined by its“very real security needs.” But Israel’s campaign in Gaza has presented a dilemma to President Biden’s administration, which has continued tosupply Israel with military aidwhile expressing growing concern over the treatment of Palestinians. Mr. Biden has said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has been “over the top” in itsconduct of the warin Gaza. And on Friday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that theAmerican governmentwas reversing a Trump administration policy and would now consider new Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories to be “inconsistent with international law.” Matthew Mpoke Biggis a correspondent covering international news.

ByHamed Aleaziz Reporting from Healdsburg, Calif. President Biden on Wednesday shielded thousands of Palestinians in the United States from deportation for the next 18 months, using an obscure immigration authority as he faces mounting criticism over U.S. support for Israel in the Gaza war. About 6,000 Palestinians are eligible for the reprieve under a program called Deferred Enforced Departure, which allows immigrants whose homelands are in crisis to remain in the United States and work legally. In a memo obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Biden said that “many civilians remain in danger” in Gaza after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. “Therefore, I am directing the deferral of removal of certain Palestinians who are present in the United States,” he said. The decision comes as Mr. Biden faces pressure over the war, particularly among Arab Americans who wereonce a reliable constituency for him. In recent weeks, pro-Palestinian groups have been demonstrating outside his campaign stops, chanting “Genocide Joe.” While Mr. Biden’s criticism of the war has grown more forceful since the Oct. 7 attack, the United States has not signaled that it plans major policy changes such as putting conditions on billions of dollars in military aid to Israel.

Terry Ahwal and her husband, Bob Morris, at their home in Farmington Hills, Mich.Credit...Nick Hagen for The New York Times Supported by ByJennifer Medina Reporting for this story included interviews with dozens of Arab American voters in and around Detroit. Tucked down in Terry Ahwal’s basement is her personal wall of fame: Here she is at the Obama White House Christmas party. Here is a framed thank-you note from President Bill Clinton. There she is grinning alongside Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan. President Biden, Ms. Ahwal says, will not appear on her wall. After a lifetime of work in Democratic politics — running local campaigns, asking strangers for money, begging acquaintances to vote for candidates — she is now campaigning against the Democrat in the White House. A Palestinian American who emigrated from the West Bank more than 50 years ago, Ms. Ahwal is furious over the president’s alliance with Israel in its war against Hamas that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza. She does not even have a better candidate in mind, but she vows there is nothing Mr. Biden can do to get her back now. “You want my vote? You cannot kill my people in my name. As simple as that,” she said recently, sitting at the dining room table of her home in Farmington Hills, a Detroit suburb. Photographs of her travels to Jordan, Peru and the Great Lakes decorate her walls. “Everything Israel wants, they get.” Such promises to punish Mr. Biden in November have the power to reshape American politics — if they hold. Michigan is home to 200,000 Arab Americans, and other crucial battlegrounds have smaller, but sizable populations. While there are no firm estimates of how many are registered voters, even modest numbers of defection from Democrats could spell trouble for the president’s re-election campaign. Mr. Biden won Michigan by 154,000 voters in 2020. Donald J. Trump won the state in 2016 by 10,700. There is no shortage of fury and disappointment directed at Mr. Biden in and around Detroit, where Palestinian Americans often display maps of pre-1948 Palestine and keys to family homes seized or abandoned during the Israeli war of independence. Ms. Ahwal regularly wears a pendant in the shape of the contested land, with a line from a Palestinian poet: “This earth is something worth living for.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByAishvarya Kavi Reporting from Washington An airman who had set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington in protest of civilian deaths in Gaza died of his injuries on Sunday night, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Air Force, Rose M. Riley, said on Monday. The airman, Aaron Bushnell, 25, of Whitman, Mass., was a cyberdefense operations specialist with the 531st Intelligence Support Squadron at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas and had served on active duty since 2020, the Air Force said in a statement on Monday night. Mr. Bushnell appeared to have filmed the protest on Sunday and livestreamed it on the social media platform Twitch. The New York Times could not confirm who was behind the account that posted the video, but the footage matched the details of the episode released by the police. A man dressed in fatigues identifies himself in the video as Mr. Bushnell and calls himself an active-duty Air Force officer. “I will no longer be complicit in genocide,” a man says in the video, echoing language that opponents of Israel’s military offensive in Gaza have used to describe the war. “I am about to engage in an extreme act of protest, but compared to what people have been experiencing in Palestine at the hands of their colonizers, it’s not extreme at all.” Standing in front of the gates of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, he sets his phone down to douse himself in a clear liquid from a metal bottle.

As the Gaza war rages, with civilian deaths soaring, few Arab leaders have publicly voiced their visions for the future of the battered enclave, fearing they will be accused of endorsing Israel’s actions. But one influential Palestinian exile, in an interview with The New York Times, has provided public insight intothe types of postwar plans that Arab leaders are privately discussing. Mohammed Dahlan, an adviser to the president of the United Arab Emirates, outlined one under which Israel and Hamas would hand power to a new and independent Palestinian leader who could rebuild Gaza under the protection of an Arab peacekeeping force. While such plans face steep challenges, the leaders of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates are open to supporting processes that are part of efforts leading to a Palestinian state, said Mr. Dahlan, who also hasclose tiesto Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Officials from six Arab governments gathered in Saudi Arabia last week to discuss the future of Gaza and the need for a cease-fire, according to two Palestinian officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Under the plan outlined by Mr. Dahlan and echoed privately by Arab nations, a new Palestinian leader would assume responsibility for Gaza and the parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank currently administered by the Palestinian Authority. That leader would replace Mahmoud Abbas, the authority’s 88-year-old president, who would retain a ceremonial role, Mr. Dahlan said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But any change risks alienating Jewish voters. ByAaron BoxermanandJonathan Weisman Aaron Boxerman reported from Jerusalem, and Jonathan Weisman from Charleston, S.C. The Biden administration’s reversal of Trump-era policy on settlements in the occupied West Bank reflects not just its rising frustration with Israel, but the political bind the president finds himself in, just days before the Democratic primary in Michigan, where a large Arab American population is urging voters to register their anger byvoting “uncommitted.” During a trip to Argentina on Friday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken called any new settlements “inconsistent with international law,” a break with policy set under the Trump administration and a return to the decades-long U.S. position. The Biden administration is increasingly fed up with the Israeli government’s conduct in the Gaza war and beyond, with officials speaking out more publicly on contentious issues, said Nimrod Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum think tank. As an example, he cited a U.S. decisionto slap financial sanctionson four Israelis — three of them settlers — accused of attacking Palestinians in the West Bank at a time when settler violence against Palestinians has increased. Yet, Mr. Novik called Mr. Blinken’s remarks “too little, too late,” adding that the administration’s moves “in practice, are disjointed. The message is there, but it’s a tactical statement where the overall strategy is unclear.” The United States has long been Israel’s most important international ally. Since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7 left 1,200 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, Washington has consistently backed Israel’s blistering campaign in Gaza. The Biden administration has also shielded Israel from international censure by blocking cease-fire resolutions at the United Nations Security Council, even as the death toll in Gaza nears 30,000, according to health officials in the enclave. That stance has increasingly left Mr. Biden in a no-win situation. His recent moves to press the Israeli government to wind down the war in Gaza and enter negotiations toward a Palestinian state have angered some ardent supporters of Israel in the United States. Yet they have come nowhere close to placating Israel’s fiercest critics on the political left and the Arab American community. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The strikes were intended to degrade the Iran-backed militants’ ability to attack ships in sea lanes that are critical for global trade, a campaign they have carried out for almost four months. American and British warplanes hit missile systems and launchers and other targets, the officials said. Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand provided support for the operation, according to a joint statement from the countries involved that was emailed to reporters by the Defense Department. The strikes, which the statement called “necessary and proportionate,” hit 18 targets across eight locations in Yemen associated withHouthi underground weapons storage facilities, missile storage facilities, one-way attack unmanned aerial systems, air defense systems, radars and a helicopter. “These precision strikes are intended to disrupt and degrade the capabilities that the Houthis use to threaten global trade, naval vessels, and the lives of innocent mariners in one of the world’s most critical waterways,” the statement said. The strikes were the largest salvo since the allies struck Houthi targets on Feb. 3 and came after a week in which the Houthis have launched attack drones and cruise and ballistic missiles at vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

But daily life is also a struggle against hunger, cold and a growing sanitation crisis. A lack of sufficient toilets and clean water, as well as open sewage, are problems that displaced Palestinians have struggled with since the early days ofIsrael’s assault onGaza. For two months after Salwa al-Masri, 75, and her family fled to the city of Rafah, at the southernmost tip of Gaza, to escape Israel’s military offensive, she said she would walk 200 yards to reach the nearest bathroom. If she was lucky, younger women in line would let her jump ahead. Other times, she might wait up to an hour to use a dirty toilet shared with thousands of other people. “It’s horrible,” Ms. al-Masri said via WhatsApp recently from her family’s ramshackle tent, which they made out of wood and plastic sheeting. “I wouldn’t drink water. I would stay thirsty so I wouldn’t have to go to the bathroom. I stopped drinking coffee and tea.” Many other Gazans, already facinghungerandthirstas a result of Israel’s more than four-month siege of the territory, say they, too, have tried to cut back on eating and drinking even more to avoid an uncomfortable and unsanitary visit to the toilet. Recently, Ms. al-Masri’s son and other relatives bought a cement toilet basin and dug a hole behind their tent, where the sewage gathers. It is a closer bathroom and one she shares with fewer people.

ByPatrick KingsleyandThomas Fuller Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel released on Friday his most detailed proposal yet for a postwar Gaza, pledging to retain indefinite military control over the enclave, while ceding the administration of civilian life to Gazans without links to Hamas. The plan, if realized, would make it almost impossible to establish a Palestinian state including Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, at least in the short term. That would likely accelerate a clash between Israel and a growing number of its foreign partners, including the United States, that are pushing for Palestinian sovereignty after the war ends. The blueprint for Gaza comes after nearly 20 weeks of war in the territory and a death tollapproaching 30,000 people, at least half of them women and children, according to Gazan authorities. Mr. Netanyahu’s proposal for postwar Gaza was circulated to cabinet ministers and journalists early on Friday. He has laid out most of the terms of the proposal in previous public statements, but this was the first time they had been collected in a single document. The proposal also calls for the dismantling of UNRWA, the U.N. agency charged with delivering the bulk of the life-sustaining aid to the besieged territory. And it calls for an overhaul of the Gazan education and welfare systems, as well as buffer zones along Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt. The plan was circulated on the same day that American, Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials began negotiations in Paris over the release of hostages and a possible cease-fire.

ByGaya GuptaandVictoria Kim A cargo ship damaged by a Houthi missile and abandoned in the Red Sea is slowly taking on water, the U.S. military said early Saturday, warning that its sinking could be environmentally disastrous because of a large load of fertilizer it was carrying. The operator of the vessel, called the Rubymar, said the partly submerged ship was still afloat and would soon be towed to Djibouti or Aden, a port city in Yemen. Its remaining cargo would be transferred to another ship and sent to Bulgaria, said Roy Khoury, the head of the ship’s operator, Blue Fleet Group. The ship’s engine room and one of its holding compartments are underwater, he said. The U.S. Central Command said ina statement on social mediaearly Saturday that the damage to the vessel had created an 18-mile oil slick. The command called it an “environmental disaster” that could get much worse if the tens of thousands of tons of fertilizer the ship was carrying were to spill into the Red Sea. Though few of the Houthi missile and drone attacks on ships in the Red Sea since the start of Israel’s war in Gaza have inflicted major damage, the attack on the Rubymar appeared to be one of the Houthis’ more serious to date. At least one missilestruck the shipon Monday night after being fired from a part of Yemen controlled by Houthi militants, the U.S. military said. The Houthis, an Iran-backed group that has been targeting ships in what they call a campaign to pressure Israel to stop the war in Gaza, later claimed that they had sunk the ship. But satellite imagery and the ship’s operator confirmed that the Houthis had not. The U.S. Central Command said it was anchored but slowly taking on water. After the Rubymar was hit, its crew issued a distress call and then abandoned ship, according to the Central Command. A coalition warship responded to the distress call, and the crew was taken to a port by a merchant vessel in the area, a Central Command statement said.

Neighborhoods have been flattened, families wiped out, children orphaned, and anestimated 1.7 million peopledisplaced. While global scrutiny grows over Israel’s conduct in the war, the Israeli military, by its assessment, has delivered a major blow to the capabilities of Hamas, killing commanders, destroying tunnels and confiscating weapons. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s goal of destroying Hamas remains elusive, according to current and former Israeli security officials. They anticipate a protracted campaign to defeat Hamas. An Israeli military intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity under military protocol, said that Israel was engaged in a comprehensive mission to unravel Hamas’s military capabilities. “Is it possible this mission will be left for my children?” he said. “The answer is yes.” U.S. officials say they believe Hamas has been constrained by the Israeli operations, but that Israel will not be able to achieve, in the foreseeable future, its goal of eliminating the group’s military capability. The officials requested anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. Israel launched its assault on Gaza after a Hamas-led attack against Israel on Oct. 7 in which an estimated 1,400 people were killed or taken hostage.

","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by Israel says Hamas routinely operates within — and beneath — places like Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, using them as shields, and has held Israeli hostages there. The group denies the charges. ByVivian Yee Reporting from Cairo The Israeli military on Thursday raided the largest hospital still functioning in the Gaza Strip, in what it called a search for Hamas fighters and the bodies of hostages. Many people who had sought shelter there were forced to flee from combat once again. Explosions and gunfire rocked the hospital in the city of Khan Younis, the Nasser Medical Complex, before the predawn raid, killing and wounding several people including at least one doctor and a patient, according to a doctor there, as well as the charity Doctors Without Borders, which had staff members at the hospital, and Gaza health authorities. The specific casualty claims, like many assertions in the conflict, could not be immediately confirmed. Videos postedon social media on Thursday and voice messages sent by doctors during the night, both before and after Israeli forces smashed through the perimeter wall and entered the compound, depicted scenes of chaos and fear inside the damaged, smoke-filled hospital, punctuated by automatic gunfire, explosions and shouting. One video,verified by The New York Times, showed damage to the hospital and injured people being rushed through a smoke-filled corridor among debris amid sounds of gunfire. Witnesses said people by the hundreds — possibly thousands — later stood in long lines as Israeli troops screened them, a few at a time, for evacuation. The Israeli military said it had detained dozens of people, but did not say who or why. “We have credible intelligence from a number of sources, including from released hostages, indicating that Hamas held hostages at the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, and that there may be bodies of our hostages in the Nasser hospital facility,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, saidin a video statement. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

ByHiba YazbekandThomas Fuller Intense bombardment of a Gaza Strip city filled with refugees flattened a large mosque and killed or wounded scores of people on Thursday as Israel repeated its intention to push into the area with ground forces if Hamas does not release hostages before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Nearly 100 people were killed across the enclave from Israeli strikes over the past day, the Gazan health authorities said Thursday, bringing the total death toll after almost 20 weeks of war to nearly 30,000. Around half of the Gaza Strip’s population of 2.3 million people are crammed into the southern city of Rafah along the border with Egypt, where the strike on the mosque occurred Thursday. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, reported that at least seven Palestinians had been killed overnight in Rafah and dozens more wounded. Israel’s preparations for an invasion of that area come as diplomats raced to forestall it, with Ramadan set to begin around March 10. President Biden’s Middle East coordinator, Brett McGurk, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday for “a good couple of hours,” focusing on whether negotiators could “cement a hostage deal” according to a White House spokesman. Talks last week in Cairo for a hostage deal failed when Mr. Netanyahu withdrew his negotiators, accusing Hamas of refusing to budge onwhat he called “ludicrous” demandsand pledging to press on with Israel’s offensive.

Advertisement Supported by Itamar Moses wrote a drama of ideas about Israel and antisemitism. Then Oct. 7 happened. ByMarc Tracy Before his audition for “The Ally,” a new play by Itamar Moses, the actor Michael Khalid Karadsheh printed out the monologue that his character, Farid, a Palestinian student at an American university, would give in the second act. The speech cites both the Mideast conflict’s specific history and Farid’s personal testimony of, he says, “theexperienceof moving through the world as the threat of violence incarnate.” Karadsheh — who booked the part — was bowled over. “I don’t think anyone has said these words about Palestine on a stage in New York in such a clear, concise, beautiful, poetic way,” said Karadsheh, whose parents are from Jordan and who has ancestors who were from Birzeit in the West Bank. Farid’s speech sits alongside others, though, in Moses’s play: one delivered by an observant Jew branding much criticism of Israel as antisemitic; another by a Black lawyer connecting Israel’s policies toward Palestinians to police brutality in the United States; another by a Korean American bemoaning the mainstream’s overlooking of East Asians. These speeches are invariably answered by rebuttals, which are answered by their own counter-rebuttals, all by characters who feel they have skin in the game. In other words, “The Ally,” which opens Tuesday at the Public Theater in a production directed by Lila Neugebauer and starring Josh Radnor (“How I Met Your Mother”), is a not abstract and none too brief chronicle of our times, a minestrone of hot-button issues: Israelis and Palestinians, racism and antisemitism, free speech and campus politics, housing and gentrification, the excesses of progressivism — even the tenuous employment of adjunct professors.

But the Israel-Hamas war has made the effort much more complicated. ByDana Goldstein As an education reporter, I’m always looking for good news on my beat. So I perked up back in 2016 when sources in California started buzzing about a study out of Stanford University showing that ethnic studies classes in San Francisco had helped improve grades and attendance among teenagers who were at risk of dropping out. That research was persuasive to policymakers, and, after years of flirting with the idea, California education officials started to write a state curriculum in ethnic studies. In 2021, state lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom enacted a law requiring high schools to offer an ethnic studies course by 2025, and making the subject a requirement for graduation from high school starting with the class of 2030. Over the last month, I’ve beenchecking inon how that mandate is rolling out across the state — and why the Israel-Hamas war has made the effort much more complicated. The key tension comes down to the difference between what many legislators thought they were getting when they voted for ethnic studies — a type of broad multicultural curriculum rooted in local history — and what ethnic studies actually is, as defined by university scholars with doctorates in the field. The discipline has roots in student activism in the Bay Area in the 1960s against racism, segregation, colonialism and militarism. It looks at four groups in particular: Black Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans. And the Palestinian experience of displacement is central to ethnic studies. Some scholars see the Palestinians’ situation as perhaps the most crucial current-day example of the pattern of settler colonialism that brought Europeans to the Americas and led to the displacement and genocide of Native Americans.

ByMark Landler Reporting from London WhenDavid Ben-Gurion, one of Israel’s founding fathers, was warned in 1955 that his plan to seize theGaza Strip from Egyptwould provoke a backlash in the United Nations, he famously derided the U.N., playing off its Hebrew acronym, as “Um-Shmum.” The phrase came to symbolize Israel’s willingness to defy international organizations when it believes its core interests are at stake. Nearly 70 years later, Israel faces another wave of condemnation in the United Nations, the International Court of Justice, and from dozens of countries over itsmilitary operation in Gaza, which has killed an estimated 29,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, and left much of the territory in ruins. The huge swell in global pressure has left the Israeli government and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, deeply isolated, if not yet bowed, largely because it still has the support of its staunchest ally, the United States. This time, though, Israel faces a rare break with Washington. The Biden administration is circulating a draft resolution in the United Nations Security Council that would warn the Israeli military not to carry out a ground offensive in Rafah, near Egypt, where more than a million Palestinian refugees are sheltering. It would also call for a temporary cease-fire as soon as practical. “It’s a big problem for the Israeli government because it has previously been able to hide behind the protection of the United States,” said Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel. “But now Biden is signaling that Netanyahu can no longer take that protection for granted.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMarlise Simons,Cassandra Vinograd,Neil MacFarquharandThomas Fuller The United States on Wednesday defended Israel’s decades-long occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, arguing at the U.N.’s highest court that Israel faced “very real security needs.” The defense came a day after the United States issued its thirdveto against a call for an immediate cease-fire in Gazaat the United Nations Security Council, a vote that drew an angry response from nations and aid groups that have urged a stop to the fighting to help Gaza’s civilians. The latest show of American support for Israel was at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where Richard C. Visek, the acting legal adviser at the U.S. State Department, urged a 15-judge panel not to call for Israel’s immediate withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territory. transcript Any movement towards Israel’s withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza requires consideration of Israel’s very real security needs. We were all reminded of those security needs on Oct. 7, and they persist. Regrettably, those needs have been ignored by many of the participants in asserting how the court should consider the questions before it. It is more urgent than ever to proceed to a Palestinian state, one that also ensures the security of Israel and makes the necessary commitments to do so. In light of these considerations, the court should not find that Israel is legally obligated to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from occupied territory. Others have asked you to broadly construe the questions and the law. They have asked you to try to resolve the whole of the dispute between the parties through an advisory opinion addressed to questions, focusing on the acts of only one party. The United States disagrees with that, that this approach would be consistent with the court’s role within the United Nations or the established U.N. framework for achieving peace through negotiations. He said that only the establishment of an independent Palestinian state “living safely and securely alongside” Israel could bring about lasting peace, repeating a longstanding U.S. position, but the prospect of which appears even more elusive amid the war in Gaza. “This conflict cannot be resolved through violence or unilateral actions,” Mr. Visek said. “Negotiations are the path to a lasting peace.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Edward Wong, who was accompanying the U.S. secretary of state, reported from Brasília. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken confronted President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil on Wednesday about his recent sharp comments on Israel, including the Brazilian leader’scomparison of Israel’s attacks in Gaza to the Holocaust. The sparring showed how the enduring war in Gaza has continued to expand into a broader diplomatic problem for the United States, and how the war’s mounting death toll has spurred more nations to speak out against Israel’s offensive. An intensifying dispute between Brazil and Israel broke out this week over Mr. Lula’s comments on Sunday that the only comparison to Israel’s killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza is “when Hitler decided to kill the Jews.” It was a significant escalation of his previous rhetoric. Since then, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said Mr. Lula “crossed a red line,” Israel’s foreign minister called Brazil’s ambassador to the Holocaust museum and scolded him in front of the media, and Israel’s official account on XsaidMr. Lula “went full on Holocaust denier.” Brazil responded byrecalling its ambassador to Israel“for consultations” and,according to Brazilian news outlets, discussed expelling Israel’s ambassador to Brazil if the situation escalated further. In a 90-minute meeting in Brasília, Brazil’s capital, Mr. Blinken had a “frank exchange” with Mr. Lula, saying that he disagreed with the Brazilian leader’s recent statements and that the United States was trying to get hostages held by Hamas freed and get extended humanitarian pauses enacted, according to a senior U.S. State Department official.

In the images, several dozen young men, some of them carrying clubs, attempt to block the passage of a convoy of trucks as they drive along a major highway in southern Gaza after entering the territory from Egypt. The trucks are briefly forced off the road as the drivers swerve to avoid hitting the men. Some of the assailants throw stones at the trucks’ windshields, seemingly to try to stop them. The images, with time stamps indicating they were taken in recent days, were reviewed by a reporter for The Times. Suchattacks have become commonsince Israel’s invasion last year as desperate civilians face starvation in pockets of the enclave, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid complicating their work in Gaza. In one recent attack, assailants threw an ax at a driver’s cabin, attempting to break into it, while in another the attackers hurled a cement block, according to one of the officials. Israel blames much of the theft on Hamas, which it accuses of siphoning off supplies for its own forces. But the Western officials said the attacks appeared to be mostly organized by groups of Gazans who were unaffiliated with Hamas, or were the spontaneous acts of desperate civilians. Hamas officials are barely present on the ground in any part of Gaza, the officials said, and international aid organizations are no longer coordinating their movements with the group that until October controlled the entirety of the territory. The ambushes on aid convoys are partly a result of a breakdown in law enforcement, the officials said. Gazan policemen are now refusing to protect the convoys because they fear they will be targeted by Israel because of their affiliation with the Hamas-run government, the officials said. That leaves the convoys more vulnerable, they added. Foreign diplomats privately say that enough food is reaching the Gazan border via Egypt to prevent famine, but the problem is its distribution to areas beyond Rafah, the southern city that lines the border with Egypt. In northern Gaza, aid groups say another major obstacle is the difficulty in coordinating safe passage with the Israeli military. Unlike southern Gaza, the north is mostly under full Israeli control, and aid groups say Israel regularly blocks access to Gaza City and its surrounding districts. Israel has accused the aid groups of failing to coordinate their convoys closely enough with the Israeli government, and says that not all requests for access can be granted because of continued fighting. In one case in early February, the United Nations accused the Israeli navy of shelling an aid convoy heading up Gaza’s coastal road toward Gaza City. The Israeli military said it was looking into the claim. Patrick Kingsleyis the Jerusalem bureau chief, covering Israel and the occupied territories.

ByHiba Yazbek reporting from Jerusalem Palestinians in Rafah described a night of fear as Israeli strikes pummeled the area early Monday, killing and wounding dozens, according to the Gazan health ministry, and highlighting the cost of Israel’s military operation to free its hostages. “I swear to God it was an indescribable night,” said Ghada al-Kurd, 37, who is among more than a million people sheltering in the southern Gaza city. “The bombing was everywhere — we were convinced that the Israeli army was invading Rafah.” Israel’s military said early Monday that it had conducted a “wave of attacks” on Rafah to provide cover for soldiers whofreed two hostagesheld by Hamas. The health ministry in Gaza said that at least 67 people had been killed in the strikes, and that the toll was likely to rise. The ministry’s figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Dr. Marwan al-Hamase, the director of Abu Yousef al-Najjar Hospital in Rafah, said that the hospital had received 100 injured people overnight, along with the bodies of 52 who were killed. Maher Abu Arar, a spokesman for the Kuwait Hospital in Rafah, said the hospital had taken in at least 15 bodies and 50 wounded people. “There were a lot of body parts,” said Mr. Abu Arar, following “successive and sudden” Israeli strikes. Ms. al-Kurd said that people in Rafah were panicking and considered evacuating during the night, but “no one knew where to even go.” She added in a voice message that her young nieces “were crying and I was trying to calm them down,” even though she was also “very scared.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

U.S. Vetoes Security Council Cease-Fire Resolution,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/20/world/middleeast/us-vetoes-ceasefire-resolution.html,2024-02-20T22:30:17+0000,"The United States said the resolution could have disrupted its negotiations to free hostages and secure a temporary cease-fire, but its vote drew outcry from many diplomats and aid workers.","The United States on Tuesday cast the sole vote against a United Nations Security Council resolution that would have called for an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, saying it feared it could disrupt hostage negotiations.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by The United States said the resolution could have disrupted its negotiations to free hostages and secure a temporary cease-fire, but its vote drew outcry from many diplomats and aid workers. ByFarnaz Fassihi,Cassandra VinogradandThomas Fuller The United States on Tuesday cast the sole vote against a United Nations Security Council resolution that would have called for an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, saying it feared it could disrupt hostage negotiations. It was the third time Washington wielded its veto to block a resolution demanding a stop to fighting in Gaza, underlining America’s isolation in its continued, forceful backing of Israel. Over four months of war, Israel has come under increasing international pressure over the scope and intensity of its campaign against Hamas in Gaza, with many leaders decrying the high civilian death toll. transcript The United States is working on a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, along with Egypt and Qatar. This hostage deal would bring an immediate and sustained period of calm to Gaza for at least six weeks. And from there we could take the time to build a more enduring peace. But sometimes hard diplomacy takes more time than any of us might like. Still, that desire cannot blind us to the reality of the situation on the ground. It, and it cannot come at the expense of undermining the only, and let me repeat, the only path available toward a longer durable peace. And that is why you’ve heard me say over and over again, any action this council takes right now should help, not hinder these sensitive and ongoing negotiations. And we believe that the resolution on the table right now would, in fact, negatively impact those negotiations. Demanding an immediate, unconditional cease-fire without an agreement requiring Hamas to release the hostages will not bring about a durable peace. Instead, it could extend the fighting between Hamas and Israel. Algeria’s U.N. ambassador, Amar Bendjama, lashed out at the United States on Tuesday, telling the Council that the veto “implies an endorsement of the brutal violence and collective punishment inflicted upon” the Palestinians. He said “silence is not a viable option, now is the time for action and the time for truth.” The diplomatic maneuvering comes at a time when aid organizations are warning that urgent assistance is needed for a population suffering from severe malnutrition and the spread of infectious disease.

ByCassandra VinogradandMatthew Mpoke Bigg Israel’s military ordered two neighborhoods of Gaza City to evacuate on Tuesday amid signs of hunger and mounting desperation in the northern part of the enclave at a time when the focus of Israel’s offensive has shifted south. The evacuations came as the World Food Program halted deliveries in the north on Tuesday, describing scenes of chaos as its teams faced looting, hungry crowds and gunfire in recent days. The fiercest fighting and most intense bombing has in recent weeks shifted south to areas around Khan Younis and Rafah. But the evacuation order from Israel’s military on Tuesday for the Zaytoun and Turkoman neighborhoods of Gaza City raised the possibility of further military moves in the north. Northern Gaza has been decimated by four months of bombardment, and continued fighting there between Israeli forces and Hamas fighters has severely hindered deliveries of aid to the estimated 300,000 people still in the area, who the United Nations has warned face starvation. The W.F.P. had suspended its deliveries for the past three weeks because of safety concerns, and on Sunday the agency tried to restart them, but “crowds of hungry people” surrounded the initial convoy as it was going to Gaza City, and aid workers were forced to fend off people trying to climb onto the trucks, the organization said in a statement. Another convoy on Monday “faced complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order,” the statement added, saying that several trucks were looted and a driver was beaten.

They let us sit in on one of their meetings. ByAdam Sella Video byGuy Barak,David Blumenfeld,Alexandra EatonandEmily Rhyne On a sunny January day, dozens of Israelis and Palestinians crowded into a small house in a town outside Bethlehem, as their compatriots fought in the Gaza Strip, to talk about a subject that has become nearly taboo in their cities and towns: How to build a lasting peace. “This thing is not appropriate in the community we live in,” said Aya Sbeih, a Palestinian member of the group that was meeting in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Combatants for Peace. “So I keep it a secret.” Many peace groupshave been strugglingsince Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack and Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which have hardened the positions of many Israelis and Palestinians. But some activists, including those in Combatants for Peace, have quietly started to resume their work. Ms. Sbeih, a member of the group for seven years, said she had come to several recent meetings with newfound doubts about peace activism, at least in the current climate. And some attendees said they now feel uncomfortable speaking publicly about their work. But Ms. Sbeih said the meetings “always give me hope that something will happen.” Founded by former fighters from both sides of the conflict, Combatants for Peace drew a range of people to its January meeting, including young students just returned from reserve duty in Gaza and longtime peace activists. Some said they were fed up with despair and wanted to latch onto a glimmer of hope. But they face intense opposition in their communities, where grief and anger dominate over the Oct. 7 attacks, which Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people, and over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 27,000 people, according to Gazan health officials. Since the war began, support has increased “for hard-line positions of violence, and you can see that in both Israeli and Palestinian society,” said John Lyndon, the executive director of the Alliance for Middle East Peace, an organization of peace groups.

ByPatrick Kingsley,Vivian YeeandVivian Nereim The Israeli government was locked in debate on Monday on whether to increase restrictions on Muslims’ access to an important mosque compound in Jerusalem during the holy month of Ramadan, leading to predictions of unrest if the limits are enforced. The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that a decision had already been reached, without disclosing what it was. But two officials briefed on the deliberations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss a sensitive matter, said a final decision would be made only after the government received recommendations from the security services in the coming days. On Sunday, Israeli cabinet ministers debated whether to bar some members of Israel’s Arab minority from attending prayers at the Aqsa Mosque compound, a site which is sacred to Muslims and Jews alike, during Ramadan, according to the two officials. Israel has long limited access to Al Aqsa for Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and since the start of the war in Gaza, it has imposed extra restrictions on Arab citizens and residents of Israel. Some had hoped those limits would be largely lifted for Ramadan, which is expected to begin around March 10 — but the talk now is of increasing them, instead. Dan Harel, a former deputy chief of staff in the Israeli military, said in a radio interview that such a move would be “unnecessary, foolish and senseless” and might “ignite the entire Muslim world.” One Arab Israeli lawmaker, Waleed Alhwashla, said on social media that it would be “liable to pour unnecessary oil on the fire of violence.” In Muslim tradition, it is from the site of Al Aqsa compound that the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven, and tens of thousands of Muslims visit the mosque every day during Ramadan. For Jews, it is revered as the Temple Mount because it was the site of two Jewish temples in antiquity that remain central to Jewish identity. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByVivian Yee An Israeli raid last week has reduced one of Gaza’s biggest hospitals to little more than a shelter for a small, terrified crew of patients and medical staff, while health officials warned on Monday that food and fuel supplies were almost gone at another hospital that has endured a nearly monthlong siege in the same city, Khan Younis. Israel says it is rooting out Hamas activity at the medical centers, which it says Hamas has used to hide military operations — accusations it has made about multiple hospitals in Gaza,backing up some claims with evidence of Hamas tunnels. Hamas and health officials deny those charges, and aid groups have called on Israel to respect international laws protecting hospitals from attack. It was not possible to verify statements made by either the Israeli military or the health ministry. At Nasser Medical Complex, Gaza’s second-largest hospital, 14 patients were evacuated in a United Nations mission on Sunday, the World Health Organization said. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said 18 more were evacuated on Monday. The United Nations said negotiations were continuing for the Israeli military to allow the remaining patients — numbering more than 150, according to the World Health Organization — to be evacuated. The exodus was prompted by a raid on Thursday by Israeli troops who entered the hospital and detained what Israel said was hundreds of people, including some it said had taken part in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Thousands of displaced Palestinians sheltering there evacuated before and during the raid. Caring for the remaining patients are 15 health care workers, with no tap water, little food and oxygen, few medical supplies and no electricity except a backup generator that maintains some lifesaving equipment, the W.H.O. said. The W.H.O.’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Sunday that Nasser was no longer functional. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByIsabel Kershner,Vivek ShankarandTalmon Joseph Smith The largest medical facility still managing to function in wartime Gaza is now a hospital in little more than name only, the head of the World Health Organization said on Sunday. After a week of siege by the Israeli military, there are only about 20 critically ill patients left at Nasser Hospital — but even that is too many for it to handle, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O. director general. “Nasser hospital in Gaza is not functional anymore,” Dr. Tedrossaid on social media. Dr. Tedros said on Sunday that some 200 patients remained at the hospital in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, and that about 20 of them urgently needed to be transferred elsewhere. “The cost of delays will be paid by patients’ lives,” he said. Israel has justified its military actions at the hospital by saying that Hamas militants have been using it and other medical centers to conceal military activities, and on Sunday it said it had found both weapons and Hamas militants at the Nasser complex. Hamas has repeatedly denied using hospitals as cover. On Thursday, after days of repeated orders for the thousands of civilians taking shelter at the hospital to leave, Israeli forces began staging a raid. Asked about the W.H.O. statement, a spokesman for the Israeli military, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, said in a briefing that “it’s in our best interest that the hospital keeps functioning.” He said that work was being done to fix a broken generator there and that a temporary generator was in use.

But the show is as much about the art that cannot be displayed, lost forever in the war. ByRaja Abdulrahim Reporting from Birzeit, West Bank The incessant buzzing of an Israeli drone fills the room. On one large wall, scenes of death and desperate rescues by hand through twisted metal and crushed rock play out on a video loop. A large mound of rubble — metal rods, bricks and broken plaster — extends nearly the length of the exhibition hall. Along blue walls meant to evoke Gaza’s sky and sea hang paintings that mostly evoke life before Israel’s intense bombardment and invasion: Palestinian still lifes, native cactuses, music, cats and cows, and even one Catwoman. The work of more than 100 Gazan artists lines the walls of this exhibition, which is showing at the Palestinian Museum in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a collection of protest that is as much about the art that is not there, lost inthe war that rages in Gaza, as about the art that is on display. Most of the artists are trapped in the enclave, struggling to survive, much less to create. “We resist with our colors and our canvases in order to relay our message to the world,” said Basel El Maqosui, an artist displaced from his home in northern Gaza whose work is featured. “They destroyed all our civilization and destroyed our modern and ancient artifacts,” he said in an interview. “Each of which carries a memory full of love and joy and another memory full of sadness and tears.” High on the wall in the hall hangs his painting of a Palestinian woman, her head, face and shoulders rimmed by layers of colorful scarves — red, yellow and blue. 20 miles Mediterranean Sea Jordan R.

ByAdam RasgonandAaron Boxerman Reporting from Jerusalem Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel insisted on Saturday that Israel would not bow to international pressure to call off its plan for a ground invasion of Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza that is now packed with more than a million Palestinians. Many of the people now in Rafah are displaced and living in schools, tents or the homes of friends and relatives, part of a desperate search for any safe refuge from Israel’s military campaign, which has dragged on for more than four months. Their lives are a daily struggle to find enough food and water to survive. “Those who want to prevent us from operating in Rafah are basically telling us: Lose the war,” Mr. Netanyahu said at a news conference in Jerusalem on Saturday evening. “It’s true that there’s a lot of opposition abroad, but this is exactly the moment that we need to say that we won’t be doing a half or a third of the job.” About the same time as Mr. Netanyahu addressed the news conference, thousands of anti-government protesters filled a central thoroughfare in Tel Aviv — the largest protest against the prime minister in months. They filled the same street where mass protests against Mr. Netanyahu’s efforts to weaken the country’s judiciary riled the nation before the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Calls for an immediate election rose above a din of air horns. Protesters lit a red flare in the middle of a drum circle while others wielding flags stared down half a dozen police officers on horseback. “The people need to rise up, and the government needs to go,” said one protester, Yuval Lerner, 57. Mr. Lerner said that even before the war, he lost confidence that the government has the nation’s best interest at heart, but “Oct. 7 proved it,” he said.

Protesters this month in Tel Aviv calling for the release of hostages taken from Israel on Oct. 7.Credit... Supported by BySteven Erlanger Photographs bySergey Ponomarev Steven Erlanger reported from Jerusalem, Army Base Julis, Tel Aviv, and Beersheba to try to get a sense of Israel’s mood four months into the war against Hamas. After the Hamas invasion on Oct. 7, Doron Shabty and his wife and their two small children hid in Sderot, near the border with Gaza, and survived. A reservist in the infantry, he went into the army the next day. He just returned after more than 100 days in Gaza, having lost friends. Mr. Shabty, 31, who sees himself on the political left, said he felt no sense of revenge, even if other soldiers did. Nor did he justify every act of the Israeli military, expressing sorrow over the many thousands of Gazans killed in the fight against Hamas. But he said he felt certain that to restore Israelis’ faith in their country’s ability to protect them, there cannot be a return to the situation of Oct. 6. “We can’t live with an armed Gaza — we just can’t do that,” he said. “And in order to disarm Gaza, you need to pay a terrible price.” The shock of Oct. 7 was emotional, physical and psychological, undermining the idea of security, both personal and national, and reminding Israelis that they have powerful enemies next door who wish them dead and gone. Four months into the war, with mounting deaths, hostages still held by Hamas and no clear victory in sight, their own pain has numbed many Israelis to the suffering of Gazans, let alone the pain of the Palestinian citizens of Israel itself. As of Feb. 17, Gaza’s Ministry of Health reported that more than 28,000 Gazans had been killed in the war, largely civilians, though the figures did not distinguish between them and combatants. The toll vastly outnumbers Israeli deaths since Oct. 7, when some 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Kathy Hochul apologized on Friday night for remarks she made at a Jewish philanthropy event in New York City that implied that Israel would be justified in destroying Gaza because of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. In a speech on Thursday at the event, for the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of New York, Ms. Hochul began by calling out Hamas for being a terrorist organization that “must be stopped,” saying that Israel could not continue to live with “that threat, that specter over them.” She then attempted to make an analogy to the United States, relating the war to her hometown, Buffalo. “If Canada someday ever attacked Buffalo, I’m sorry, my friends, there would be no Canada the next day,” Ms. Hochul saidin a video of the speech posted on social media. “That is a natural reaction. You have a right to defend yourself and to make sure that it never happens again. And that is Israel’s right.” In a statement provided to The New York Times on Friday night, after the speech began circulating on social media, Ms. Hochul said that she regretted her “inappropriate analogy.” She apologized for her “poor choice of words.” “While I have been clear in my support of Israel’s right to self-defense, I have also repeatedly said and continue to believe that Palestinian civilian casualties should be avoided and that more humanitarian aid must go to the people of Gaza,” she said. In apost on X, Assemblyman Zohran Kwame Mamdani said: “Governor Hochul justifying genocide, while laughing. Disgusting.” The backlash to the governor’s comments represented new territory for Ms. Hochul, who has rarely courted controversy during her time in office, in stark contrast to her predecessor, Andrew M. Cuomo. Ms. Hochul had been addressing the annual U.J.A. lawyers division event at the Pierre Hotel. The event was geared toward supporting the foundation’s “critical work in response to mounting needs on the ground in Israel and ongoing needs in New York and around the world,”according to its website. The foundation posted about Ms. Hochul’s remarkslater Thursday night on X, thanking her “for always standing with the Jewish community and against antisemitism and hate in New York.” The governor’s speech comes as the war in Gaza is escalating. Israel ramped up its military operations this week along the Gaza-Egypt border, wherethe vast majority of Gazans have fledduring the war. International leaders have warned that the operation could end in catastrophe, with President Emmanuel Macron of France saying that the situation could become an “unprecedented humanitarian disaster.” Claire Fahyreports on New York City and the surrounding area for The Times.

Prominent Black Church Leaders Call for End of U.S. Aid to Israel,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/us/ame-church-us-israel-aid.html,2024-02-17T02:10:23+0000,The African Methodist Episcopal Church Bishops Council says American financial assistance to help Israel fight its war in Gaza supports “mass genocide.”,"Leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the country’s oldest and most prominent Black Christian denominations, called this week for the United States to end its financial aid to Israel, saying the monthslong military campaign in Gaza amounted to “mass genocide.”","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by The African Methodist Episcopal Church Bishops Council says American financial assistance to help Israel fight its war in Gaza supports “mass genocide.” ByAudra D. S. BurchandMaya King Leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the country’s oldest and most prominent Black Christian denominations, called this week for the United States toend its financial aid to Israel, saying the monthslong military campaign in Gaza amounted to “mass genocide.” The statement was issued by the church’s Council of Bishops, its executive branch, and signed by four senior bishops, including the council president, Bishop Stafford J. N. Wicker. Black churches and other faith groups havepushed for a cease-firein the Israel-Hamas war for months in advertisements, open letters and social media campaigns. Black faith leaders across denominations have amplified their calls as the number of dead rises. More than 28,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials there, many of them women and children. But the A.M.E. council’s statement goes further than a cease-fire demand, insisting that the United States immediately stop its financial support of Israel. It came as Israeli forces pushed into southern Gaza and prepared for a ground assault on Rafah, where more than a million displaced Palestinians are trapped. The latest war between Israel and Hamas erupted on Oct. 7, after a Hamas attack on Israel killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. The conflict has been a point of tension between PresidentBiden, who has stood by Israelduring the war, andAfrican Americans, many of whom have taken up the Palestinian cause. Several Black clergy members said the war could weaken an already fraught relationship between Mr. Biden and Black voters, Democrats’ most loyal voting bloc.

ByClyde McGrady Clyde McGrady writes about race and identity. He spoke with activists and leaders from groups representing African Americans, Jews and Palestinians. One hot Saturday in August 2014, Sandra Tamari scrolled through social media and learned that a Black teenager namedMichael Brown had beenfatally shot by a police officerin nearby Ferguson, Mo. Her heart “just sank,” she recalled, when she learned that Mr. Brown’s mother had stood on the other side of the police tape while her son’s body had been lying in the street for hours. Ms. Tamari, who is Palestinian American and lives just outside St. Louis, had spent the previous weeks mourning the death of Muhammad Abu Khdeir, a 16-year-old Palestinian boy. He had been kidnapped, bludgeoned andburned to death in Jerusalem by Israeli teenagersavenging thekillings of three Israeli teensby Palestinians. The incident was part of acycle of violencethat culminated inthe 2014 War in Gaza that summer, which killed more than 70 Israelis and more than 2,200 Palestinians. “I was already in so much grief about what was happening in Palestine,” she said. She could not shake the parallels in her mind between Michael and Muhammad. To her, they were both teenagers stolen from their families by racially motivated violence. A week later, she and about 15 members of the St. Louis Palestine Solidarity Committee joined the protests that sprang up after Mr. Brown’s killing. Before they left, her husband grabbed some old white cloth and made a banner that read: “Palestine Stands with Ferguson.” A decade later, the Palestinian cause in the United States has become tightly intertwined with the much more powerful African American quest for civil rights — an alliance that has been both strengthened and tested in the four months of warsince Hamas killed more than 1,200 people in Israel.

Mazi Pilip, an Israeli American and a longtime registered Democrat, is now running as the Republican candidate in a congressional special election on Long Island. She has made support for Israel central to her campaign.Credit...Haruka Sakaguchi for The New York Times Supported by ByRoss Barkan Ross Barkan is a contributing writer for the magazine. He conducted 15 interviews with members of Congress, candidates, activists and political strategists for this article. When George Santos, the indicted fabulist, was expelled from Congress in December, Nassau County Republicans scrambled to hunt up a new nominee. Santos was a catastrophe, but he had also flipped a New York Democratic stronghold, and party leaders wanted the best of him — the charisma, the conservatism and the history-making potential — with none of the debilitating drawbacks. There had been chatter about a Nassau County legislator who, in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, moved some listeners at a local Jewish Community Center to tears. Mazi Pilip, an Ethiopian-born Israeli American, recounted how her family members had huddled together in a bomb shelter. She told one sister that she wanted to put on, once more, the uniform of the Israeli military. “I had a hope, a little hope, one day there will be a peace,” she recalled, her voice cracking. “I have so many family members, right now, fighting.” The speech alone most likely did not persuade Republicans to nominate Pilip in the Feb. 13 special election to replace Santos. But it may have been decisive. They needed someone who could go up against Tom Suozzi, the veteran Democrat who gave up the seat to run unsuccessfully for governor in 2022 and was now running again. Pilip, despite her avowed conservatism, has been a longtime registered Democrat; she seemed the perfect candidate to help Republicans aggressively court a Jewish community that once backed Democrats and was now, in the anguished weeks after Oct. 7, debating whether the party should represent them again. “The lefty progressive Democrats, they do not support Israel,” Pilip told me. “It’s shameful. When I go to Congress, they’ll face a Black woman, a mother of seven children, a former I.D.F., a proud American. They’re going to faceme.” Pilip’s candidacy is emblematic of a remarkably volatile moment in American politics. Since Hamas killed around 1,200 people and took about 240 hostages, and Israel retaliated by shelling Gaza, leaving more than 26,000 dead, there has been a sense within the Democratic Party of a divide that cannot be bridged, an eruption of ill feeling that will not dissipate.

ByPatrick Kingsley,Adam Rasgon,Ronen BergmanandVictoria Kim Reporting from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Munich and Seoul Israel said on Friday that it would not try to force Palestinians from southern Gaza into Egypt, seeking to calm Palestinian fears of a mass displacement even as Israeli forces pressed ahead with a military operation inside the largest hospital in the area. After months of speculation that the Israeli invasion of Gaza after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks would end with millions of Gazans being pushed into northeastern Egypt, Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said on Friday that no one would be forced to leave. The announcement appeared to reversesecret Israeli efforts earlier in the warto promote the idea of sending millions of Gazans into Egypt, a move that Palestinians feared might lock them out of their homeland and led to warnings that Egypt might suspend its peace treaty with Israel. Photographs also show that Egypt has startedconstructionnear the border, which some fear is meant to house a sudden rush of refugees from Gaza. In a statement, Mr. Gallant said: “The State of Israel has no intention of evacuating Palestinian civilians to Egypt. We respect and value our peace agreement with Egypt, which is a cornerstone of stability in the region as well as an important partner.” Mr. Gallant does not always coordinate his statements with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but the prime minister’s office later released a similar statement, echoing Mr. Gallant’s remarks. Mr. Gallant’s intervention came amid growing concern from international leaders that Israel’s planned operation along the Gaza-Egypt border, where the majority of Gazans have sought shelter after fleeing their homes elsewhere in Gaza, would end in catastrophe.

ByAaron Boxerman At least two people were killed and four others wounded when a gunman opened fire at a bustling intersection in central Israel on Friday afternoon, the Israeli authorities said. Avi Bitton, an Israeli police commander, said that the attack took place at a bus stop near the town of B’nei Re’em at around 12:30 p.m. The gunman was shot by an armed civilian on the scene and appeared to have acted alone, the Israeli police said, calling it an act of terrorism. Six victims of the attack were taken to hospitals in central Israel where two of them were pronounced dead, according to the Israeli emergency service Magen David Adom. The Israeli authorities did not formally identify the attacker or comment on his condition. The Israeli news media reported that the gunman was a Palestinian from East Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel condemned the attack and extended his condolences to the victims. “This attack reminds us that the entire country is on the front line,” hesaid in a statement. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Friday’s shooting. Israel has been on high alert since the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7. In late November,at least three peoplewere killed when Palestinian gunmen who the Israeli authorities said were affiliated with Hamas’s armed wing opened fire at a Jerusalem bus stop. On Friday, Hamas praised the shooting near B’nei Re’em and called it “a natural response” to the war that Israel’s military is waging against the armed group in Gaza.

ByAnemona Hartocollis A congressional committee said Friday that it subpoenaed Harvard University in a hunt for documentation of whether the university tolerated antisemitism on its campus. The move is part of an expanding Republican effort to investigate elite universities for their response to pro-Palestinian student demonstrations, especially after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel. The committee has also started investigations into Columbia, M.I.T. and the University of Pennsylvania. But Harvard is the first to receive subpoenas. The Israel-Hamas war has exposed deep political divisions among Harvard students, faculty members and alumni, which contributed to the resignation last month of Claudine Gay, the university’s first Black president. Harvard, like many other universities, has said it must protect Jewish students while also protecting free speech, but critics have said that university officials have allowed demonstrations to veer into antisemitism. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce said the subpoenas were served to Harvard’s interim president, Alan Garber; the head of its governing corporation, Penny Pritzker; and N.P. Narvekar, the chief executive officer of its management company, which handles the university’s endowment. The subpoenas did not come as a surprise, since in the last few days, the committee had reprimanded Harvard for withholding or heavily redacting documents and warned that it would take legal action.

ByKate Kelly Reporting from Washington When the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the most influential pro-Israel group in the United States, wants to use its muscle, it can call on its considerable resources to run negative ads against lawmakers who oppose its agenda and pour money into funding a challenger. When the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker group that is pushing for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, wants to push its message, its Middle East lobbyist turns to tactics like playing guitar with schoolchildren in the occupied West Bank and sharing video messages about their fears with members of Congress on Capitol Hill. Going up against the many forces backing Israel is a challenge for any group. But the clash is especially striking when it comes to the Friends Committee, whose antiwar positions are in sync with much of the left of the Democratic Party but run counter to Biden administration policy in the wake of the Hamas terror attack and face intense opposition on the right. AIPAC, founded about 70 years ago to promote Israel’s interests in the U.S., is a juggernaut. Last year, its nonprofit arm reported more than$73 millionin revenue. Last month, its political action committee, which supports candidates who embrace its policy priorities, reportedrecord fund-raising— bolstering a $40 million war chest that could be spent trying to defeat political opponents in Washington. It has the ear of congressional leaders in both parties. The Friends Committee, which was founded during World War II, is part of what amounts to Washington’s peace lobby. It does not run a political action committee. It reports about$3 millionin annual revenue. Its lobbying approach involves looking for “the divine in the people that we’re meeting with,” Sarah Freeman-Woolpert, the Quaker group’s deputy director of strategic advocacy, says in avideo.

ByAnushka Patil International alarm over a potential Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, in southern Gaza, has intensified in recent days, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatens to invade the city near the Egyptian border. Over half of the Gaza Strip’s entire population of more than two million is sheltering in Rafah, according to the United Nations, an area of about 25 square miles. Many of them were repeatedly pushed southward by Israeli military orders to move into so-called safe zones. They are now trapped against Gaza’s southernmost edge, largely living inmakeshift tentswith little food orclean water, underaerial bombardmentandawaiting the terrifying prospectof soldiers advancing on them once again. Mr. Netanyahu hasordered the Israeli militaryto draw up plans to evacuate civilians from Rafah before any offensive, though human rights groups say there is little chance that an evacuation of such scale could be carried out in compliance with international law. They also say that because Rafah is the primary portal for aid to Gaza, any military ground operations there would have disastrous consequences on the entire enclave. Warnings have come from nearly every part of the world, including from Israel’s most powerful allies. Here are some of the most notable. The United States:A ground invasion of Rafah should not proceed “without a credible and executable plan” for ensuring the safety of displaced civilians, President Biden told Mr. Netanyahu in a phone call on Sunday,according to the White House. The United States is a top financial backer of the Israeli military, and its most steadfast diplomatic ally. On Tuesday, John F. Kirby, Mr. Biden’s national security communications adviser, declined to answer questions about what the United States would do if Israel moved on Rafah without such a plan, saying,“Let’s see what they come up with.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByDana Goldstein California has grand ambitions for ethnic studies. By 2025, the state’s public high schools — about 1,600 of them — must teach the subject. By 2030, students won’t be able to graduate high school without it. For policymakers, a goal is to give California students, 80 percent of whom are nonwhite,the opportunity to study a diverse array of cultures.Researchhas shown that ethnic studies classes can raise grades and attendance for teenagers at risk of dropping out. But even in a liberal state like California, scholars, parents and educators have found themselves at odds over how to adapt the college-level academic discipline for high school students, especially because of its strong views on race and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While the name “ethnic studies” might bring to mind a broad exploration of how ethnicity and race shape the human experience, the discipline, as taught in universities, is narrower — and more ideological. Ethnic studies focuses on four groups: Black Americans, Latinos, Native Americans and Asian Americans. It aims to critique various forms of oppression and spur students to take action, often drawing analogies across disparate expanses of time and geography. The Palestinian experience of displacement is central to that exercise, and has beencomparedby some scholars to the Native American experience. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Anything to avoid thinking about his son, Muhammed. As the Israeli military targeted the southern city of Khan Younis in early December and fighting with Hamas intensified, his family’s home was struck while he was visiting a neighbor, Mr. Abutaha said. His brother was killed. Three of his five children were injured. And Muhammed, 18, was found motionless in a stairwell. “If somebody sends me his picture, I just shout at him and say: ‘Please don’t remind me of my son. He’s already dead. Please, I don’t want to bring back memories,’” Mr. Abutaha said. “Oblivion, forgetfulness, is a blessing from God.” Soon after the strike, he said, he and his family fled to Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, at the time one of the last facilities in the Gaza Strip still offering medical care and shelter to the displaced. Now, its operations are in peril. Israeli forcesraided the hospital on Thursday, saying this was aimed at Hamas activity inside, afterordering the evacuationof the thousands of civilians sheltering there earlier this week. Hundreds of patients, staff members and displaced Palestinianshad already fled, including Mr. Abutaha, though many remained.

ByVimal Patel Vimal Patel writes about higher education. The U.S. Education Department said on Tuesday that it had opened an investigation into Harvard over whether it failed to protect Palestinian, Muslim and Arab students and their supporters from harassment, threats and intimidation. Harvard has been in turmoil for months over its response to the attack on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza, which played a part inthe eventual departure of the school’s president, Claudine Gay. The Education Department has already openeda separate investigation into Harvard over complaints of antisemitism. The Muslim Legal Fund of America, which filed a civil-rights complaint that led to the new investigation, said more than a dozen students had faced harassment. Students were “threatened or called terrorists,” sometimes by fellow students, for wearing keffiyehs,a Palestinian scarf, said Christina A. Jump, a lawyer for the group. Others were doxxed and intimidated, yet Harvard administrators dismissed the concerns, she said. School administrators instead met with donors and alumni who “encouraged the harassment,” said Chelsea Glover, another lawyer on the case. The complaint, which lawyers for the group did not provide, does not name any donors or alumni, Ms. Jump said. “Harvard’s primary responsibility should be to its current students, not wealthy donors and alumni with personal agendas that harm students who support Palestinian rights,” Ms. Glover said. In a statement on Tuesday night, Harvard said that it supported the work of the Office for Civil Rights of the Education Department “to ensure students’ rights to access educational programs are safeguarded and will work with the office to address their questions.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Thousands of Gazans have sheltered at the Nasser Medical Complex in the southern city of Khan Younis for weeks, and many are terrified that Israeli forces will bombard or storm the complex, said Mohammed Abu Lehya, a doctor there. Previous Israeli warnings to evacuate hospitals,including Al-Shifa, the largest in Gaza, have often preceded military raids. Hanin Abu Tiba, 27, an English teacher sheltering at the hospital, described dire conditions inside, with food running out and aid convoys all but unable to deliver supplies. In text messages overnight, she said that she had seen an Israeli military vehicle outside the hospital gate. “I’m terrified to leave the hospital and get shot,” she said. But inside the complex, she said, “the electricity is cutting out, and the water, and the canned food is almost gone. We don’t know what to do.” Dr. Abu Lehya, in a WhatsApp message on Wednesday, called conditions at the hospital “beyond imagination.” The tensions at the hospital played out as Israel carried out extensive airstrikes in southern Lebanon on Wednesday in response to a deadly rocket attack on northern Israel. The rocket attack struck a military base near the city of Safed, killing a soldier and wounding eight people, the Israeli authorities said.There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion quickly fell on Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia allied with Hamas.

ByJohnatan ReissandGaya Gupta As talks continued in Cairo toward an Israel-Hamas cease-fire, Israeli media reported on Wednesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had told his negotiators not to take part, infuriating some family members of hostages still in Gaza who say that the government is not doing enough to rescue their relatives. Mr. Netanyahu’s office did not directly confirm or deny the reports, instead issuing a statement saying that Hamas had not made any new proposal, but that “a change in Hamas’s position will allow progress in the negotiations.” Mr. Netanyahu later posted on social media that “strong military pressure and very tough negotiations” would be key to freeing more of the remaining hostages seized during the Hamas-led assault on Israel on Oct. 7. He praised the Israeli military operation thatfreedtwo hostages held by Hamas in Rafah on Monday. Officials from Israel and the United States met this week with Hamas mediators from Qatar and Egypt to discuss a possible deal to trade hostages for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons and to suspend the four-month war in Gaza. Those talks are still underway in Cairo, but, according to Israeli news outlets, Mr. Netanyahu told Israel’s representatives not to return to Cairo. TheHostages and Missing Persons Families Forum, the main alliance of the hostages’ family members, responded to the reports by protesting outside the homes of Mr. Netanyahu; Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister; and Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s war cabinet, on Wednesday evening. “This decision amounts in effect to sacrificing knowingly all of the hostages’ lives,” theHostages and Missing Persons Families Forumsaid in a statement. The group has mounted increasingly aggressive protests against Mr. Netanyahu’s government to urge it to prioritize the release of their family members. More than 130 hostages captured by Hamas on Oct. 7 remain in Gaza, including at least 30 who are believed to have died, according to the Israeli security services. Other family members havesaidthat the Israeli military should continue its war against Hamas until it has reached its goals, even if that means their relatives must remain in captivity. Officials have said that in negotiations, Israel and Hamas were far apart on the number of imprisoned Palestinians who would be exchanged for the hostages and on the duration of a cease-fire. Hamas has demanded an end to the war and the withdrawal of Israeli troops, while Israel insists that it will only agree to a temporary pause in the fighting. The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, called on Wednesday for Hamas to speed up an exchange of hostages for prisoners to spare Palestinian people further “catastrophe” in the war, according to Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency.

ByAdam Goldman Christopher A. Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, made an unannounced trip to Israel on Wednesday to meet with officials from the country’s intelligence and law enforcement agencies, the F.B.I. said. As part of the visit, his first to Israel since the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of Oct. 7, Mr. Wray also spoke with F.B.I. agents working in Israel, the bureau said in a statement on Wednesday, stressing the importance of their efforts to counter threats from Hezbollah and Hamas. The United States designates both as terrorist groups. Mr. Wray spoke with officials from Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency; Shin Bet, Israel’s equivalent of the F.B.I.; and the Israeli National Police, according to a person familiar with his trip to Israel, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Details of the trip were made public after Mr. Wray had departed Israel. The F.B.I. has been working closely with its counterparts in Israel after the attacks on Oct. 7, which Israeli authorities say killed about 1,200 people. About 250 others, including American dual nationals, were abducted in the attacks. The F.B.I. has opened cases involving crimes against Americans committed by Hamas or others. “The F.B.I.’s partnership with our Israeli counterparts is longstanding, close and robust,” Mr. Wray said in a statement, “and I’m confident the closeness of our agencies contributed to our ability to move so quickly in response to these attacks, and to ensure our support is as seamless as possible.” The United States has created a C.I.A. task force to help Israel hunt down Hamas’s top leaders while America’s spy agencies have also raised the priority of intelligence collection on Hamas. The C.I.A. has also been heavily involved in negotiations for the release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas and its allies, and President Biden has dispatched the agency’s director, William J. Burns, to join the cease-fire talks in Cairo. After the visit, Mr. Wray headed to Germany for the Munich Security Conference. Adam Goldmanwrites about the F.B.I. and national security.

ByAaron BoxermanandPatrick Kingsley reporting from Jerusalem The Israeli finance ministry has blocked deliveries of food for Gaza because the shipments were intended to reach the main U.N. agency for Palestinians, Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said on Tuesday. Mr. Smotrich, a hard-right settler leader, said in a statement that he had issued a directive not to transfer flour shipments to the agency, known as UNRWA, citing allegations that some of itsemployees were affiliated with Hamas, including 12 accused of participating in the armed group’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Last week, a subcontractor handling the shipments for UNRWA received a call from Israel’s customs agency — which is housed in Mr. Smotrich’s ministry — ordering it not to process any UNRWA goods in its warehouse, said Juliette Touma, an UNRWA spokeswoman. About 1,050 containers — much of it flour — have been held up at the Israeli port of Ashdod, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, told reporters on Friday. The amount was enough to feed 1.1 million Gazans for a month, he said. Mr. Lazzarini said UNRWA still has enough supplies to feed Gazans for three months, but only because the food is now being routed through Egypt rather than Israel. Israel’s action once again put it at odds with the Biden administration, which has criticized the Israeli conduct of the war in increasingly blunt terms. “That flour has not moved the way that we had expected it would move, and we expect that Israel will follow through on its commitment to get that flour into Gaza,” Jake Sullivan, president Biden’s national security adviser, told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. Mr. Smotrich said another aid distribution mechanism would be found “that would not reach Hamas,” which he said was utilizing UNRWA as a “key part of its war machine.” UNRWA has said it is investigating the allegations, but has stood by its work as essential humanitarian relief in a complex situation.

Haneen Faroukh, 26, said she now had to wait for hours to run simple errands. Israeli soldiers had sown panic among ordinary Palestinians who make the crossing frequently to reach jobs, doctors, relatives or just their homes. “They yell at us all the time,” said Ms. Faroukh. “We’re too scared to say anything.” For many Palestinians, life in the West Bank, already hard under years of Israeli occupation, is now subject to ever more onerous restrictions and an increased military presence since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel that killed an estimated 1,200 people. Israeli authorities have created new choke points for travel, throttling traffic. They have stopped allowing many Palestinians to work in Israel, a lifeblood for the local economy. And they have increased the intensity of raids and arrests in West Bank neighborhoods. The Israeli military says there has been a “significant increase in terrorist attacks” in the West Bank since Oct. 7, necessitating the need for the additional security measures and raids. Many Palestinians who spoke to The New York Times say these measures, at times humiliating, have provoked frustration and anger. They have watched in horror as an estimated 26,000 people, including friends and relatives, have been killed under heavy Israeli bombardment in Gaza, while facing worsening conditions at home under Israeli authority and attacks at the hands of Jewish settlers.

Officials called them promising, but an accord did not seem imminent. ByVivian Yee,Julian E. BarnesandMichael Levenson Vivian Yee and Julian Barnes reported from Cairo, and Michael Levenson from New York Negotiators from multiple countries met in Cairo on Tuesday, struggling to reach an agreement to temporarily stop the war in the Gaza Strip, as international concern mounted over Israel’s plan to press its ground offensive into the city of Rafah, where more than half of the territory’s population has sought refuge. Talks involving lower-level officials will continue for another three days, according to an Egyptian and an American official briefed on the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. They described the negotiations on Tuesday as promising, but Israel and Hamas were still not close to a deal. A primary obstacle, according to another U.S. official, is a disagreement on how many Palestinians Israel would release from its prisons in exchange for the release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas and its allies. A series of exchanges in late November saw three Palestinians released for each hostage returned. President Biden sent the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, to join the talks, and said that he had spoken with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the leaders of Egypt and Qatar to “push this forward” over the past month. Officials of Hamas, the armed group fighting Israel, were taking part in the negotiations indirectly, using Qatar and Egypt as intermediaries. The talks came as the United Nations, the United States and other countries have expressed increasing alarm about the prospect of an Israeli incursion into Rafah on the southern edge of Gaza, where about 1.4 million people are sheltering, many in tents, without adequate food, water and medicine. Mr. Netanyahu has said that Israel will conduct such an offensive and has ordered the military to draw up plans to evacuate civilians from the city. But many Palestinians and international aid groups say that no place in Gaza is safe, and that moving people away from Rafah, the main entry point for vital aid, will worsen their lot.

ByKurt Streeter Reporting from Ann Arbor, Mich. They represent opposite corners at the University of Michigan, two sides of student activism who have hunkered down and almost never communicate. Salma Hamamy is one of the most prominent faces of the pro-Palestinian movement on campus. “One, two, three, four, open up the prison doors!” she shouts, bullhorn in hand, as she leads anti-Israel rallies in front of crowds of fellow students. “Five, six, seven, eight, Israel is a terrorist state!” Ms. Hamamy has helped lead over 20 protests since Hamas’s deadly attacks against Israel on Oct. 7 and the resulting bombardment of Gaza. As she booms out calls for an end to war, or rails against a university administration that she believes has been tone deaf toward Palestinians, she knows she can look into the audience and find a familiar, though vexing, face: Josh Brown, a fellow student and Ms. Hamamy’s opposite in nearly every way. Mr. Brown is perhaps the most fervent counterprotester at Michigan. A hard-and-fast supporter of Israel and Zionism, he shows up for almost every pro-Palestinian rally at his school, sometimes alone, always with a cellphone at the ready so he can record what he believes to be rampant antisemitism. “These are extremists,” says Mr. Brown, speaking of the groups that Ms. Hamamy is a part of and helps lead. “What they are calling for is the destruction of my people.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByLynsey ChutelandMarlise Simons With Israel continuing to warn that it plans a ground invasion of Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza, South Africa has asked the International Court of Justice in The Hague to issue new constraints on Israel’s military offensive to prevent genocide. In a filing on Monday, the South African government said that it was “gravely concerned” by Israel’s planned ground advance into Rafah, where more than a million Gazans have sought shelter, which it said “has already led to and will result in further large-scale killing, harm and destruction.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who has described Rafah as Hamas’s last stronghold, said on Sunday that a ground invasion would move forward there as soon as Israel completed plans for the more than a million people sheltering in the city to be allowed to move to safety. In December, South Africa filed a case with the International Court of Justice, the U.N.’s highest court, accusing Israel of genocide and asking the court to step in with emergency orders. In response,the court ordered Israel last monthto ensure that its actions would not lead to genocide and to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza. But the court did not order a halt to fighting in the Gaza Strip. The process of considering whether Israel is committing genocide could take the court several years. In its request on Monday, South Africa argued that a ground invasion of Rafah would be in breach of the court’s January orders and that the court should consider further emergency measures, though it did not lay out what it believed those should be. The court said that it had asked Israel for comment. Under court rules, the judges will have to consider South Africa’s request as a matter of priority. That could mean scheduling a hearing or issuing a new order as early as Monday. The court is also starting a six-day hearing on another issue involving Israel on Monday. Israel’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, but Israel has rejected accusations of genocide. On Monday, Israeli forces freed two hostages held in the city ina nighttime commando operation, which was accompanied by a series of airstrikes. The health ministry in Gaza said at least 67 people had been killed in the strikes. Overall, the ministry says, more than 28,000 people in Gaza have been killed. After the rescue mission, Mr. Netanyahu said that “only continued military pressure, until total victory, will bring about the release of all of our hostages.” Johnatan Reisscontributed reporting.

Several of its volunteers died in the Hamas attacks, and donations to the group have slowed. ByGal Koplewitz Nearly every week for a decade, Iri Kassel picked up sick Palestinian children at Israel’s Erez border crossing with Gaza and drove them with their guardians to Israeli hospitals for treatment. But on Oct. 7, the crossing was raided by Palestinian militants who blasted the passport control booths and magnetic scanners as they stormed into southern Israel. The deadly attacks plunged Israel into all-out war in Gaza and disrupted the work of Road to Recovery, the Israeli nonprofit organization that Mr. Kassel volunteers for, which has ferried more than 1,500 Palestinian patients a year to Israeli hospitals. Several of the group’s volunteers died in the Hamas-led attack, includingVivian Silver, a prominent peace activist who was killed in her home atKibbutz Be’eriin southern Israel. Others were taken hostage, like Oded andYocheved Lifshitz, a couple in their eighties from Nir Oz, a kibbutz near the Gaza border. Dozens more lost loved ones or were evacuated from their homes near Gaza. The organization’s staff and volunteer drivers were devastated. “It was a blow to the stomach,” Mr. Kassel said. Even for those who survived the attacks, he said, there was “an almost physical pain.” Road to Recovery was founded in 2010 by Yuval Roth, a peace activist whose brother had been kidnapped and killed nearly 20 years earlier by Hamas militants.

The nighttime operation — only the second time Israeli forces said they had rescued captives in Gaza — prompted elation in Israel, where the fate of more than 100 people kidnapped during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7 has become one of the country’s highest priorities. But in Rafah, the raid fueled fear, mourning and panic amongmore than a million Palestinianswho have crowded into the city, seeking refuge from Israeli military actions farther north. Palestinians feared that the raid presaged a full-fledged ground invasion into Rafah, and that the high death toll foretold much more mourning ahead. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said that Israeli ground forces are preparing to enter Rafah with the goal of eliminating Hamas battalions there. The prospect of ground battles in the city, which is bracketed by a closed Egyptian border and invading Israeli forces, has created worldwide alarm over the risks to civilians who have nowhere else to flee. The intensity of the rescue operation and the death toll made clear Mr. Netanyahu’s determination to press ahead with the southern offensive, despite criticism from the United States and other allies, and pressure to reduce civilian casualties and destruction.

ByIsabel Kershner,Andrés R. MartínezandSarah Maslin Nir Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, brushing aside a chorus of international condemnation, said Sunday that a ground invasion of the southern Gazan city of Rafah would move forward as soon as Israel completed plans for the more than a million people sheltering there to be allowed to move to safety. “Those who say that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah are basically saying: ‘Lose the war,’” Mr. Netanyahu said on “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.” But given the complexity of an operation in Rafah, a ground invasion does not appear likely to happen any time soon, analysts said, though the city has already been hit repeatedly by airstrikes. More than half of Gaza’s 2.2 million residents fled there to avoid fighting farther north, packing the city with refugees with nowhere else to go. One Hamas official, Basem Naim, said Mr. Netanyahu was “deluding himself” if he thought that threatening to invade Rafah would increase the pressure on Palestinian negotiators to agree to Israel’s terms for a cease-fire. More than 28,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children, have already been killed since the war began in October, Gazan health officials say. “Such an invasion would mean more massacres and intensify the humanitarian disaster,” Mr. Naim said in a text message on Sunday. Yaakov Amidror, a retired Israeli general and national security adviser, said that while Israel “must go into Rafah” to achieve its objectives of dismantling Hamas’s military capabilities and its ability to rule the Gaza Strip, the invasion would take time to plan.

Israeli leaders have framed an invasion of Rafah as an imperative to achieve their goal of eliminating Hamas. But the planning for such an operation, in a city where more than 1 million Palestinians have sought shelter, is fraught with complexity and will likely take some time, according to Israeli officials and analysts. A major challenge for Israeli forces will be how to move civilians who have crowded into the city out of harm’s way. Many Gazans fled to Rafah on the instructions of the Israeli military to avoid the fighting farther north in Gaza, and a chorus of international leaders have expressed concerns that the people there have nowhere to go. The prospect of an assault on Rafah is creating tensions with Egypt, which fears a destabilizing influx of Palestinian refugees across its border. Egypt is an important strategic partner for Israel in the region and has played a key role in negotiations aimed at securing the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. And it has added to divisions with the United States, with President BidenwarningPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in a phone call on Sunday that a ground offensive in Rafah must include a plan to protect civilians. The Biden administration has also raised concern over fighting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, according to two Israeli officials with knowledge of the discussions. An attack during Ramadan — which is expected to start March 10, though the timing depends on the sighting of the moon over Mecca — could be viewed as particularly provocative to Muslims in the region and beyond.

ByHiba Yazbek reporting from Jerusalem Less than two weeks after bombs began raining down on the Gaza Strip, Ghada al-Kurd arrived in the southern city of Khan Younis. She had already been displaced three times, and hoped it would be her final journey to safety. But three months later, Israeli forces advanced south. Ms. al-Kurd, 37, speaking by telephone, said she, her sister, brother-in-law, and four nieces and nephews abandoned the tent they had been sharing “without taking anything with us,” and headed to Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city. Many of the roughly 1.7 million Gazans that U.N. agencies say have been displaced by Israel’s relentless bombardment and ground invasion have fled repeatedly over the course of a war that had now entered its fifth month. And Ms. al-Kurd’s family members number among more than a million people who have crowded into Rafah, only to hear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the Israeli military on Friday to draw up plans to evacuate “combat zones” in the city in advance of an expected ground offensive. The order, which set off international alarm, is forcing the displaced people sheltering there, along with more than 200,000 of Rafah’s citizens, to weigh their next move. “I regret leaving Gaza City,” said Ms. al-Kurd, whose two daughters stayed behind in the north with their father. “If I stayed home it would have been better than all the suffering and humiliation of displacement, because every time you flee to a new place you have to start all over again.” If Israel allows it and the roads open, she said, she will immediately go back to Gaza City, “and that will be my final time fleeing.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMegan Specia reporting from London David Cameron, Britain’s foreign secretary, has signaled that Britain is willing to move up conversations about formally recognizing a Palestinian state, saying that his country and other allies should show Palestinians “irreversible progress” toward that long-sought goal. Mr. Cameron, speaking to the Conservative Middle East Council, an organization that promotes discussion about the region among the Conservative Party, said on Monday that showing progress toward a two-state solution was essential to negotiating peace, and called Israel’s security policies of the last three decades “a failure.” The British government has long held the position that it would only recognize a Palestinian state at the “right time” in the peace process with Israel, and Mr. Cameron’s comments, in London, suggested that Britain may be aiming to do that sooner. A top priority “is to give the Palestinian people a political horizon so that they can see that there is going to be irreversible progress to a two-state solution and crucially the establishment of a Palestinian state,” Mr. Cameron said, according to the BBC, which reported his remarks. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the prime minister said that Mr. Cameron’s comments were not a departure from the government’s longstanding position about a Palestinian state. “Our position has not changed on recognition of a Palestinian state: We would do so at a time that best serves the cause of peace,” the spokesman said. “The U.K. for its part, and I think along with its allies, continues to believe that a two-state solution protects the peace and security of both Israelis and Palestinians.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Israeli officials have declared that the next phase in their effort to destroy Hamas will be in Rafah, and on Friday, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuannounced that“any forceful action in Rafah would require the evacuation of the civilian population from combat zones.” The Israeli government has not specified where the civilians would be expected to go. Rafah sits along the border with Egypt, which has so far refused to take in Palestinian refugees, fearful over its own security and worried that the displacement could become permanent and undermine Palestinian aspirations for statehood. On Saturday, Germany, Britain, Jordan and Saudi Arabia joined an international chorus condemningIsrael’s stated intention of expanding its ground invasion into the city. Aid groups, the secretary general of the United Nations and officials from the Biden administrationhave warned that an Israeli attack on Rafah would be disastrous. “An offensive by the Israeli army on Rafah would be a humanitarian catastrophe,” Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister of Germany,said in a statement on social media. “The people in #Gaza cannot disappear into thin air.” Britain’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, said on social media that he was “deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByRaja Abdulrahim A 6-year-old Palestinian girl and the two rescuers who went looking for her nearly two weeks ago were found dead on Saturday, the Palestine Red Crescent said, ending adesperate effort to discover their fates. Two rescuers with the Red Crescent were dispatched in an ambulance on the evening of Jan. 29 to find Hind Rajab, who was believed to be trapped in a vehicle in Gaza City with six dead family members. The aid group said they had been killed by Israeli fire. A Red Crescent statement on Saturday accused Israeli forces of bombing the ambulance as it arrived “just meters away from the vehicle containing the trapped child Hind,” and killing the two rescuers inside. It said this happened “despite prior coordination” between the Red Crescent and the Israeli military. The Red Crescent shared an image of thecharred and nearly unrecognizable ambulanceon social media. Neither the Red Crescent nor Hind’s family members who were in the area around the time the ambulance arrived on Jan. 29 reported any fighting between Israeli forces and armed Palestinians there, though this could not be independently verified. The Israeli military did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Red Crescent’s allegations. The military said last week that it was not aware of the incident. A spokeswoman for the Red Crescent said that the girl's family had discovered the bodies of their relatives and the ambulance crew. It was not immediately clear how Hind died.

ByPatrick KingsleyandRonen Bergman Patrick Kingsley and Ronen Bergman spoke to current and former UNRWA officials, interviewed the agency’s head, and visited a tunnel underneath the agency’s headquarters in Gaza. When the United Nations launched an investigation a decade ago into whether a handful of its employees in Gaza were members of Hamas, it was not long before a senior U.N. legal officer in the territorystarted receiving death threats. First there were emails, sent from anonymous accounts, according to three senior U.N. officials based in Gaza at that time. Then came a funeral bouquet, delivered to the main U.N. compound, labeled with the legal officer’s name. Finally there was a live grenade, sent to the compound with its pin still inside, according to two of the officials. The U.N. evacuated the legal officer, a British lawyer and former military officer, hurrying him to Jerusalem, the three people said.

ByVivian Yee Reporting from Cairo The pressure on Egypt is building. More than half of Gaza’s population issqueezedinto miserable tent cities in Rafah, a small city along Egypt’s border, left with nowhere else to go by Israel’s military campaign. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has threatened to overrun the area, and on Friday, he directed his forces to plan the evacuation of civilians from Rafah to clear the way for a new offensive against Hamas. But it is not clear where those people could go. Rather than opening its border to give Palestinians a refuge from the onslaught, as it has done for people fleeing other conflicts in the region, Egypt has reinforced its frontier with Gaza. It has also warned Israel that any move that would send Gazans spilling into its territory could jeopardize the decades-old Israel-Egypt peace treaty, an anchor of Middle East stability since 1979. Israel’s next steps in the war could force such a breaking point. Detail area Mediterranean Sea Gaza City Cairo SINAI PENINSULA EGYPT gaza strip 100 miles Red Sea PhiladelphI Corridor israel Rafah EGYPT 5 miles By The New York Times During past conflicts in the region, Egypt has taken in refugees from Syria, Yemen and neighboring Sudan. But in this war, it has reacted very differently to the plight of its Arab neighbors, spurred by a mix of alarm over its own security and fear that the displacement could become permanent and undermine Palestinian aspirations for statehood. Egyptian leaders are also wary of the Islamist Hamas stoking militancy and spreading influence in their country, as Egypt has spent years trying to quash Islamists and an insurgency at home.

ByReid J. EpsteinandErica L.

The remarks came after months of public and private admonitions from the Biden administration for Israel to take a more surgical approach in a conflict that has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians, according to health authorities in Gaza. On Thursday, Mr. Biden himself declared that Israel hadgone “over the top”in its response to the Hamas attack on Oct. 7. The Biden aide, Jon Finer, a deputy national security adviser, offered some of the administration’s clearest expressions of regret for what he called “missteps” it had made from the beginning of the violence, and he pledged that it would do better. During the meeting on Thursday with Arab American political leaders in Dearborn, Mich., Mr. Finer said, “We are very well aware that we have missteps in the course of responding to this crisis since Oct. 7,” according to a recording of the gathering obtained by The New York Times. A National Security Council official confirmed the recording was authentic. Mr. Finer added: “We have left a very damaging impression based on what has been a wholly inadequate public accounting for how much the president, the administration and the country values the lives of Palestinians.

In a statement announcing the orders on Friday, Mr. Netanyahu’s office did not give any details of when the evacuations might be carried out, when the Israeli military might enter the city or where people might go. Many civilians in Rafah are sheltering in rickety tents made of plastic and wood and say there is nowhere left in Gaza to avoid Israeli shelling. Mr. Netanyahu’s office said it would be impossible to realize Israel’s goal of smashing Hamas’s rule in Gaza without destroying what it said were the group’s four battalions in Rafah, on Egypt’s border. The military’s “combined plan” would have to both “evacuate the civilian population and topple the battalions,” the statement said. “Any forceful action in Rafah would require the evacuation of the civilian population from combat zones,” it said. Mr. Netanyahu’s office announced the orders less than a day after President Biden issued some of his sharpest criticism of Israel’s conduct in the war, calling it “over the top” and saying the starvation, suffering and killing of civilians had “got to stop.” His criticism, which dominated Israeli news headlines, revealed growing frustration with Mr. Netanyahu as the death toll in Gaza has risen above 27,000, according to the territory’s health officials. After Mr. Netanyahu said this week that he had ordered troops to prepare to enter Rafah, aid agencies, the United Nations and U.S. officials said the prospect of an incursion there was particularly alarming.

ByKayla Guo Reporting from Washington Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the former House speaker, on Sunday called for the F.B.I. to investigate protesters demanding a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas conflict, suggesting without evidence that some activists may have ties to Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin. “For them to call for a cease-fire is Mr. Putin’s message,” Ms. Pelosi said during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Make no mistake, this is directly connected to what he would like to see. Same thing with Ukraine. It’s about Putin’s message. I think some of these protesters are spontaneous and organic and sincere. Some, I think, are connected to Russia.” When pressed on whether she believed some of the demonstrators were “Russian plants,” Ms. Pelosi said: “Seeds or plants. I think some financing should be investigated. And I want to ask the F.B.I. to investigate that.” Ms. Pelosi, who was first elected speaker in 2007 and again in 2019,led House Democrats for 20 yearsbefore stepping aside for Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the minority leader. Still, she remains influential among congressional Democrats. Her remarks appear to be the first time a prominent U.S. politician has publicly suggested Russia may be backing cease-fire protests to help foment division among Democrats. The Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned Ms. Pelosi’s comments as “an unsubstantiated smear” and “downright authoritarian.” “Her comments once again show the negative impact of decades of dehumanization of the Palestinian people by those supporting Israeli apartheid,” Nihad Awad, the group’s national executive director, said in a statement. “Instead of baselessly smearing those Americans as Russian collaborators, former House Speaker Pelosi and other political leaders should respect the will of the American people by calling for an end to the Netanyahu government’s genocidal war on the people of Gaza.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But within Israel, a powerful lobby is trying to rally support for Jewish settlements there. ByNatan Odenheimer Natan Odenheimer spoke to dozens of settler activists, as well as their opponents and analysts. A group of Israelis hoping to live in Gaza at the war’s end has already published maps imagining Jewish-majority towns dotting the territory. Far-right Israeli lawmakers have drafted plans to make such settlements legal. And Israel’s national security minister has called for Arab residents to leave Gaza so that Jews can populate the coastal strip. After four months of war and a death toll that Gazan officials say exceeds 27,000 killed, international pressure is mounting on Israel to withdraw from Gaza. But a small group of Israelis is pushing for the opposite: They want Israel to retain control of the territory, from which Hamas launched the deadliest attack in Israeli history, and re-establish the Jewish settlements that were dismantled in Israel’s2005 withdrawalfrom Gaza. “The minute the war is over, we’ll build our homes there,” said Yair Cohen, 23, a reserve soldier, who said his family was evicted from Gaza in 2005. “The question isn’t whether we will return when the fighting is over, but if there will be a Gaza.” To Palestinians, the settlers’ plans would most likely end in mass displacement and an end to their dream of a Palestinian state — a dream that much of the world would like to see realized. “Israel wants the Palestinian people to choose between destruction and displacement,” the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour,told the bodylast month. But unlikely as resettlement seems to outsiders, the idea is being promoted at a time when Israel has yet to decide how postwar Gaza should be governed.

There are a lot of innocent people who are in trouble and dying. And it’s got to stop.” But even as he offered a sharp assessment of the latest events in the Middle East, he made the kind of mistake that his staff had hoped he would avoid, given questions about his age and memory, by confusing the presidents of Egypt and Mexico. “I think that, as you know, initially the president of Mexico, Sisi, did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in,” he said, referring to Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the president of Egypt, not Mexico. “I talked to him. I convinced him to open the gate. I talked to Bibi to open the gate on the Israeli side.” Mr. Biden’s comments revealed his increasing frustration with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, known by his nickname Bibi, making public what has been clear in private for weeks. Mr. Biden has pressed the Israeli leader to take greater care to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, where more than 27,000 people have been killed, according to health authorities in the strip run by Hamas, and to consider creation of a Palestinian state once the war is over.

ByRaja Abdulrahim,Patrick Kingsley,Adam RasgonandMichael Levenson Israeli airstrikes hit a southern Gaza border city crowded with civilians on Thursday, a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced a cease-fire proposal by Hamas and signaled that the Israeli military was preparing to move into the area. The strikes on two houses in Rafah killed and injured multiple people, according to Palestinian news outlets, and heightened fears among the more than one million Palestinians who have sought refuge in the city as Israel’s army has repeatedly warned that it plans to push farther south in its ground invasion. “There is no place for the people to run to,” said Fathi Abu Snema, a 45-year-old father of five who has been living in a United Nations-run school in Rafah for nearly four months. “Everyone from all other parts of Gaza ended up in Rafah. I don’t know where to go.” The strikes came a day after Mr. Netanyahu rejected a Hamas proposal that called for Israel to withdraw from Gaza, abide by a long-term cease-fire and free Palestinians held in Israeli jails in exchange for the release of remaining Israelis who were kidnapped during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack. Mr. Netanyahu said that Hamas’s demands were “ludicrous” and that accepting them would only invite further attacks on Israel. Asserting that there was “no solution besides total victory,” he said the military had been ordered to prepare to move into Rafah, on Egypt’s border, which he called one of “Hamas’s last remaining strongholds.” At a news conference in Washington on Thursday, Vedant Patel, a State Department spokesman, raised concerns about the prospect of an Israeli military incursion into Rafah. “We have yet to see any evidence of serious planning for such an operation,” he said.

A Blinken Visit Puts U.S.-Israeli Tensions on Full Display,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/world/middleeast/blinken-netanyahu-gaza-negotiations.html,2024-02-08T19:47:30+0000,"During a round of diplomacy by Secretary of State Antony J.

Blinken, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seemed to be speaking to a domestic audience that does not want to let up pressure on Hamas. ByZolan Kanno-YoungsandPatrick Kingsley Zolan Kanno-Youngs reported from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and the West Bank this week while traveling with the U.S. secretary of state. Patrick Kingsley reported from Jerusalem. As Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken sat down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel this week, American and Arab officials were expressing cautious optimism over the latest proposal from Hamas for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. But just hours after speaking to Mr. Blinken, Mr. Netanyahu appeared more intent on delivering a fiery message aimed at his domestic audience. Instead of appearing side by side at a news conference with the secretary of state after they met on Wednesday — as is customary on such trips — the Israeli leader pre-empted him. Meeting on his own with reporters, he denounced the very proposal the Americans saw as a potential opening to a negotiated solution. “Surrender to the ludicrous demands of Hamas — which we’ve just heard — won’t lead to the liberation of the hostages, and it will only invite another massacre,” Mr. Netanyahu said. Shortly after that, Mr. Blinken delivered his own, much more measured, assessment of the Hamas offer at a news conference in Jerusalem, saying that while it had “clear nonstarters,” it also left space for an agreement to be reached. On Thursday, as Mr. Blinken ended his fifth visit to the Middle East in the four months since the war in Gaza began, it was clear that relations between the Biden administration and Mr. Netanyahu have become increasingly fraught. That raised questions about how drawn out the process might be to reach an agreement to end the conflict. Mr. Blinken has been trying to secure a cease-fire in Gaza, a release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and, eventually, a broader peace process for the region. But one stumbling block during his visit seemed to be the considerable domestic political pressures facing the Israeli prime minister. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Palestinian Americans’ Lawsuit in Oakland Seeks to Halt U.S. Support for Israel,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/world/middleeast/oakland-lawsuit-biden-israel-palestinians.html,2024-01-26T22:34:39+0000,"The case, filed in Federal District Court in Northern California, is unlikely to succeed, given legal precedents regarding foreign policy decisions.

But it has energized pro-Palestinian activists. ByShawn Hubler Palestinian American plaintiffs asked a federal judge in California on Friday to force the White House to withdraw U.S. support for Israel pending a cease-fire in Gaza and accused President Biden and other administration officials of abetting a genocide of the Palestinian people. In more than two hours of testimony before Judge Jeffrey White in U.S. District Court in Oakland, plaintiffs in the unusual lawsuit expressed grief and outrage, choking back tears as they spoke of their loved ones who have been killed in Gaza. One Palestinian immigrant, who lives in Fairfield, Calif., said seven members of his family had been killed in airstrikes in Gaza, including the children of a cousin “who is like a brother to me.” Another, living in San Ramon, Calif., said his family had lost more than 100 members, and a single Israeli attack had killed his cousin, his cousin’s son, and 14 members of a neighbor’s family. The testimony came in the second judicial proceeding in a day to frame Israel’s bombardment of the embattled Palestinian enclave as a potentially grave violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention. Hours earlier, the United Nations’ highest judicial bodyordered Israelto prevent genocidal acts by its forces, as part of that court’s consideration of formal charges that Israel’s response to Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7 was crafted to deny Palestinians the right to exist. The federal case in Northern Californiais unlikely to succeed, givenlegal precedentsthat limit judicial power over U.S. presidents on foreign policy decisions. But the lawsuit has energized pro-Palestinian activists, who have convinced abouta dozen local governmentsin the Bay Area, Atlanta and other regions of the country to call for a cease-fire in Gaza. Telling the plaintiffs that he wanted them to know that they “have been seen,” the judge called the testimony “gut wrenching” and the case “probably the most difficult” he had ever dealt with.

ByMarc TracyandEmma Goldberg Marc Tracy and Emma Goldberg talked to couples from Jewish and Christian faith backgrounds, religious leaders and marriage counselors. When Ava Friedmann and Michael Henein were married, they used a tablecloth from Ms. Friedmann’s grandmother as a huppah, or ritual canopy held above the couple in a Jewish wedding. Mr. Henein’s father, who is a Coptic Christian from Egypt, anointed them with holy oil. That same braiding of their cultural traditions has steered them over the last three months, as they have talked about the Israel-Hamas war. Both were horrified by the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, but Mr. Henein worried instinctively about the Palestinian lives in Gaza that would be lost because of Israel’s military response. They decided to read identical news sources about the war to help make sure they stayed on the same page. “We needed to really hear each other and share our perspectives, and make sure we were creating an environment that didn’t lead to conflict between the two of us,” Ms. Friedmann said. Many American Jews have reconsidered how they feel about Israel and even their own Jewish identity sincethe Oct. 7 attack, in which Israeli officials say Hamas militants killed roughly 1,200 people.Israel’s reprisal, a bombing campaign and invasion, has killed more than 26,000 people, Palestinian officials say. For Jews in interfaith couples, no matter what they believe about Israel, there is the added dimension of communicating with a partner who may not viscerally feel a connection to Israel or other Jews. Their non-Jewish partners sometimes have entirely different feelings about the war and Israel, and even the most supportive spouses might struggle to understand their Jewish partners’ emotions. Jewish intermarriage rates have risen in the United States.For decades, the trend has induced anxiety among Jewish leaders in America who fret that it threatens the perpetuation of the Jewish people.A Pew Research studypublished in 2021 showed that in the United States, roughly 40 percent of Jews who wed between 1980 and 1999 married non-Jewish partners.

ByPatrick KingsleyandRonen Bergman reporting from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv Leaders of the largest United Nations agency in Gaza warned on Monday that it may soon run out of money as new allegations emerged about Hamas’s influence on the organization. As U.N. officials fretted over the future of UNRWA, the main aid agency for Palestinians, Israeli officials debated whether it made sense to publicly air accusations that a group of the agency’s workers were involved in the Oct. 7 terror attack. Some Israeli military leaders believed it was a mistake to unleash a furor, according to three Israeli officials involved in the discussions, because the agency’s collapse would leave a huge administrative and logistical vacuum in the middle of a humanitarian crisis. UNRWA plays a crucial role in Gaza — distributing food, water and medicine — and it is unclear who would fill the vacuum were it to collapse. Most of Gaza’s 2.2 million people are displaced from their homes, many are sheltering in centers and schools run by the agency, and it helps allocate the aid that arrives in Gaza each day. Israel has charged that at least 12 employees of the agency — the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees — participated in the Oct. 7 attack and that as many 1,300 employees are members of the group. The Oct. 7 assault ended with roughly 1,200 people dead and another 240 taken hostage, according to Israeli estimates. The Israeli military provided the United States with a dossier alleging that roughly 10 percent of the agency’s 13,000 employees in Gaza are Hamas members. That assessment is derived from cross-referencing an UNRWA staff list with a directory of Hamas members that soldiers found on a computer during a recent operation inside Gaza, according to the military officials. The allegationsinclude evidence that one UNRWA worker kidnapped a woman and another took part in a massacre at a kibbutz. The United Nations is investigating the charges, which were first made public on Friday, and it has fired nine of the accused. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

He spoke after meeting with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who was on the third day of a Middle East tour aimed at furthering negotiations to stop the war and ease regional tensions, which have risen since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack prompted the Israeli offensive in Gaza. Asserting that victory was “within reach” as the war hit the four-month mark, despite growing concerns among Israeli officials that their forces are mired down and their military objectives far from reach, Mr. Netanyahu said that Israel had directed its troops to prepare to advance into Rafah, on Gaza’s border with Egypt. Word that Israel was preparing a possible expansion of its operation came as American officials said they had killed a senior leader of an Iraqi-based militia they blame for recent attacks on American military personnel. The Pentagon said that a strike in Iraq had killed a commander of Kata’ib Hezbollah, the militia they say was responsible for a drone attack in Jordan last month that killed three American service members and injured more than 40.

But no deal has been struck, and it is not clear how Israel will respond to Hamas’s counterproposal.

BySharon OttermanandOlivia Bensimon The steps in front ofLow Memorial Libraryat Columbia University have been the site of major campus protests since the 1960s. But when pro-Palestinian demonstrators tried toorganize a rallythere last Thursday, the area was barricaded off. When the students instead joined a rally on the streets outside of campus the next day, they were greeted by rows of police officers. The scene was heated; 15 people were taken into custody. Since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, Columbia has been under intense pressure to rein in pro-Palestinian protests that accuse Israel of genocide and call for a cease-fire. The protests have not been violent, but some donors, trustees and students say they reflect and foment antisemitism. In response, Columbia and Barnard, the university’s sister school, have sought to enforce rules requiring extensive advance notice and barring anything that might disrupt campus activities. The measures have reduced protests. But, some students say, they have also violated free speech rights, and challenged long traditions of political protest on campuses that were historically the scenes of raucous rallies about everything from the Vietnam War to South African apartheid. And by limiting campus demonstrations about the war, the students say, the school is pushing them onto the city’s streets, where protests can sometimes turn dangerous. Often organized by established activist groups, the demonstrations have shut down traffic and shut off access to city landmarks, and the police have responded in force and made numerous arrests.

ByRonen BergmanandPatrick Kingsley Israel has called securing the freedom of the hostages abducted to Gaza a key goal in its war against Hamas, so many in the country were shocked on Tuesday when it emerged that at least a fifth of the captives were already dead. The news was likely to worsen a furor in Israel, where a debate over the government’s course of action in Gaza regarding the hostages has become divisive. Israeli intelligence officers have concluded that at least 30 of the remaining 136 hostages captured by Hamas and its allies on Oct. 7 have died since the start of the war, according to a confidential assessment that was reviewed by The New York Times. The bodies of two other dead Israelis, killed in 2014 during a previous war between Israel and Hamas, have been held in the territory ever since, bringing the total number of slain hostages inside Gaza to at least 32. The Israeli government late on Tuesday released a statement saying that only 31 had been confirmed dead; the discrepancy between the two numbers could not be immediately reconciled. “We have informed 31 families that their captured loved ones are no longer among the living and that we have pronounced them dead,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military’s chief spokesman, said Tuesday after The Times published a report about the previously undisclosed hostage deaths. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The statement by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has left Palestinians — many of whom are exhausted from relocating multiple times and sleeping in tents in cold and rainy weather — uncertain about where to seek safety. It was at least the second time in recent days that Mr. Gallantvowed to make such an advance. “We’re terrified,” said Rajab al-Sindawi, a 48-year-old secondhand clothing salesman from Gaza City. “We’ve been running away from death, moving from place to place, but now we’re at the border. Where should we go?” Mr. al-Sindawi, his wife and their seven children arrived in Rafah in early January after moving several times in search of safety. While the army considers Rafah its next operational target, the security establishment needs to complete more planning before sending ground forces into the area, said an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to communicate with the media. Entering Rafah will be “extremely complicated,” the official said, noting that security officials were taking into account Egyptian sensitivities about Israeli forces operating near the border, as well as the enormous civilian population.

While it has been reviewed by human transcribers, it may contain errors. Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions. From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise, and this is “The Daily.” We turn now to Israel, where a growing list of countries around the world have suspended funding to a UN Refugee Agency for Palestinians. Israel has now shared its intelligence, claiming at least 13 UN aid workers actually took part in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. Late last month, an explosive allegation that workers from a crucial UN relief agency in Gaza had taken part in the October 7 attacks stunned the world and prompted major donors, including the US, to suspend funding. Today, Jerusalem Bureau Chief Patrick Kingsley on what this could mean for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and how it might complicate Israel’s strategy in the war. It’s Tuesday, February 6. Patrick, hi. Hi, Sabrina. So the last time we talked, late last year, there was this growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Most of the population had been displaced. Disease and hunger were starting to emerge as bigger and bigger problems. Now, the situation has gotten worse. And in the midst of all of this, the main UN relief agency in Gaza, known as UNRWA, has been engulfed in scandal over accusations that some of its staff actually played a role in the October 7 attack. Yes. So tell me the story and what we know. What we know is this. On January 18, the head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini went to what was expected to be a routine meeting with a senior Israeli diplomat to discuss delivery of aid and fuel to Gaza, the supplies that UNRWA helps to coordinate. Instead, the Israeli diplomat dropped a bombshell accusation. He claimed that roughly a dozen employees of UNRWA had either participated in the Hamas-led raid on Israel on October 7 or, in one case, in its aftermath. Wow, so that is quite a bombshell. It’s a very serious allegation. This is just a small, tiny minority of the 13,000 employees of UNRWA in Gaza. But nevertheless, it’s too many, and certainly, not what you expect of a UN agency that is devoted to neutrality and humanitarianism. Right. So actually, tell us what this agency does in Gaza. UNRWA is the main aid organization for Palestinians that is run by the United Nations. In times outside war, it provides education and primary health care for roughly five million Palestinians across the Middle East, including more than a million in Gaza itself. It runs hundreds of schools and provides education for roughly 300,000 Gazan children. Since the war has begun, it has been the primary supplier of shelter to displaced Palestinians. More than half the population is now living in an UNRWA facility. Its schools and other facilities have provided a roof over the head of some 1.2 million Gazans since the start of the war. A crucial organization, especially in this moment. Yes, absolutely. And after that meeting with the senior Israeli diplomat, Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, begins to fire nine of the employees who are accused of participating in the attack. Two of them, we believe, are already dead, and at least one of them in the attack itself. Then, the UN starts to tell the donor states that provide UNRWA with most of its funding — chief among them, the United States. And that led to senior American diplomats being briefed on the claims, and they were presented by Israeli officials with a dossier outlining these claims. On that same day, UNRWA decided to announce to the world that these allegations had been made against some of their employees and that some of them had already been fired. Now, the UN has fired nine UNRWA members. We understand two more are being looked into. And that news led the United States, and then a cascade of more than a dozen other countries, to suspend their funding for UNRWA, pending further investigation. The US has paused funding to the UN agency that is actually providing aid to the Palestinians. Canada announced it, too, has temporarily paused any additional — The latest to halt aid being Germany — Japan and Austria became the latest countries to suspend payments. And this came on the same day — — hours after the UN’s top court ordered Israel to take measures to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza. — that the International Court of Justice in The Hague had ruled that in order to prevent a genocide, Israel needed to supply more aid to Gaza. And so at a time when more aid was supposed to be coming in to Gaza, the UN’s biggest aid agency was running the risk of collapse. The head of UNRWA is calling for all those nations who are suspending funding right now to change their minds. Given the desperate plight of so many, this would be a heavy blow if UNRWA’s operations were suspended in some way. And indeed, we’ve been told by UNRWA’s leadership that if the funds aren’t restored by the end of February, it will struggle to operate. That could have grave implications for the distribution of aid and the provision of shelter to more than a million Gazans, just at the wrong time, just as we’re told that famine is looming in parts of Gaza. More than half the buildings in Gaza are damaged or destroyed, according to UN estimates, and around 2 million people out of 2.2 million have been displaced. So it couldn’t be happening, this convergence of events, at a worse time. Right. An already bad situation is likely to get a lot worse for Gazans. Yes, exactly. What were the actual charges, Patrick? I mean, what did you learn about that? Well, to begin with, it really wasn’t clear what the specific allegations were. We had this statement from UNRWA saying that there were claims against various employees. There was talk of a dossier. But no one was releasing any information. So what me and our colleague, Ronen Bergman, did — we spent the weekend calling up as many sources as we could reach, trying to find out exactly what this dossier had said. And two days after the allegations broke, we finally got our hands on the dossier itself. And what it alleged was shocking. It said that, for example, one of the employees, a teacher, had been involved in a raid on the Israeli village of Be’eri, where roughly 100 people were killed during the October 7 attack. It said another person was involved in the kidnapping of a woman. It said that a third person was involved in the capture of a soldier’s corpse on October 7, and so on and so on. The list went on. The dossier said the information was mainly taken from wiretaps of people’s phones and also through the geolocation of people’s phones on the day of October 7. We could only confirm the identity of one of the people accused, but we had no way of verifying the material ourselves. All we knew was that UNRWA had decided themselves to take action, both firing nine people and announcing the news publicly. And that wasn’t all. The dossier also had another claim, an even bigger claim, that had not previously been reported. And that was that according to the Israeli military, roughly 1/10 of UNRWA’s staff of 13,000 inside Gaza were affiliated or members of Hamas and other militant factions. Wow. And this was an astonishing claim for an agency that is supposed to be neutral. It’s supposed to be independent of political groups, let alone armed groups. Right. And once again, this was an impossible-to-verify claim, and the Israelis have not publicly produced any evidence to support it. Nevertheless, they say that this calculation is taken by cross-referencing a list of UNRWA staff members in Gaza with lists, or a list, of Hamas members that the Israeli military had taken during its invasion of Gaza from computers that they found in Hamas bases inside the territory. But Patrick, what exactly does Israel mean when it says 10 percent of the staff, some 1,300 people were considered members of Hamas? Like, are we talking about militants, or are we talking about government bureaucrats? Because of course, Hamas is the government of Gaza. The claim was that roughly 200 of those 1,300 were involved in militant activities. The rest of the 1,300 — so the vast majority — were people involved in the political movement or the social movement of Hamas. Remember that Hamas is not just an armed faction that fires rockets at Israel or that attacked Israel on October 7. It’s also a social movement that has deep roots in society and helps to run a civilian government. And there is quite a lot of overlap between its membership and the general population of Gaza, which is not to say that the majority of Gazans are affiliated with Hamas, but just to say that in a way, it’s not that surprising that any large institution in Gaza would have some level of overlap with a political movement and a social movement as large as Hamas. UNRWA takes its staff predominantly in Gaza, from the population of Gaza. The 13,000 UNRWA staff members are mostly not international aid workers from other countries. They come from the place that they are working in Gaza. And indeed, if you go anywhere in the world, any experienced aid worker will tell you that it’s a constant challenge to maintain independence from any armed group or rebel group, be it in South Sudan or Northern Sri Lanka. And these are common challenges that affect the aid sector wherever they work. All that said, the UN is supposed to be a politically neutral body, and that’s what gives the UN its gravitas and its power. This is an institution that’s meant to be above politics, above division, and it’s not supposed to be compromised by any party to a conflict. So its workers should not be members of Hamas or any other Palestinian political armed group, for that matter. Right. If it’s true, this claim would be hugely damning. Yes. And once this information, this 10 percent figure, was brought to the attention of the wider world, it cemented in the eyes of UNRWA’s critics the idea that something was rotten within UNRWA. And that came as more countries suspended their funding. And it led, a couple of days later — And I think it’s time that the international community and the UN itself understand that UNRWA’s mission has to end. — to Benjamin Netanyahu, for the first time since the allegations were made — There are other agencies in the UN. There are other agencies in the world. They have to replace UNRWA. — calling specifically for UNRWA’s dissolution. What, if anything, has Hamas said about this? I mean, do they confirm or deny that these folks are, in fact, members of Hamas? So I asked the Hamas spokesman that question and didn’t get a clear answer. What they have publicly said is that they condemn UNRWA for criticizing the actions of anyone who has participated in what they see as legitimate resistance against Israel but what much of the world sees as acts of brutal terrorism. And they also criticized UNRWA for firing some of its employees, based on material given to it by Hamas’s enemy, Israel. So Patrick, this relationship between UNRWA and Hamas is very fraught. UNRWA is responsible for critical services in Gaza — social safety net for a big swath of the country — and that’s in normal times — and has to navigate working side by side with the government, which is Hamas, which is considered a terrorist group by the US and the EU and others. And now, in the midst of the war, UNRWA’s even more critical to the people of Gaza, who are trying to survive the bombardments and the invasion following Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel. But UNRWA is also now facing this scrutiny for having staff associated with that attack. So that’s all very complicated. It’s hugely complicated. UNRWA is independent of Hamas. It’s got formally nothing to do with the group. But it nevertheless operates within a dictatorial regime in which Hamas is the ruler. And that forces it to work side by side with Hamas. And at the same time, they also have to coordinate with the Israeli armed forces in order to ensure that aid and other supplies, and also their own international employees, can enter and exit Gaza. So this has all been very difficult to navigate for years. During the 2021 war with Israel, for example, or just after it, the most senior UNRWA official in Gaza made comments that were perceived to be favorable towards Israel’s military operations. And there was such an outcry in Gaza and from Hamas because of that, that this official was withdrawn from UNRWA. But from the Israeli perspective, this kind of tension between UNRWA and Hamas is a fig leaf that obscures a more symbiotic relationship, in which UNRWA is not fully independent and operates, in their view, under Hamas’s influence. UNRWA denies that completely and says that it’s totally neutral. But nevertheless, the accusation has long been that UNRWA works under the influence of Hamas. So in a way, this latest incident is just one in a long line of flashpoints between UNRWA and Israel that goes back decades. If, for Palestinians, UNRWA is an icon and something of a protector, to many Israelis, it’s a assistant problem. And this latest incident simply confirmed perceptions that Israelis have long held about the group. We’ll be right back. So Patrick, you said that many in Israel have long believed that UNRWA is a consistent problem. What do you mean by that? What I mean is they take issue with what they say that the agency fundamentally stands for. And that goes all the way back to the reasons why it was founded in 1949, a year after Israel was founded. At that time, you had roughly or more than 700,000 Palestinian refugees who had fled or been forced from their homes during the wars that surrounded the creation of the state of Israel. And to care for those refugees who have been scattered all across the Middle East, in Lebanon, in Jordan, and in Gaza, the UN founded one of the first UN agencies in its history. It was called the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA for short. And its job was to provide education and other services to those refugees. And for the 74 years since, it has basically acted implicitly, if not directly, to maintain the identity of those Palestinian refugees and to, in the Israeli view, sustain the idea in those refugees’ minds that one day, because they’re refugees, they might actually return to the place that they were forced from, and they might one day come back, live in the homes that their families lived in, in what became Israel. But to Israelis, that is an enormously threatening idea. Because if you had five million Palestinians returning to Israel as these refugees and their descendants now number, it would completely dilute the Jewish character of the Jewish state. And Israelis don’t want that. To Israelis, it’s also threatening because the idea of five million people coming from territory where Israel has fought many wars for decades with is a security threat. It’s also a logistical threat. How would it work if five million people, or even a small minority, come to Israel and try to move into the villages where they want to live, many of which were destroyed? Right. Then, there’s another perspective, which, more or less, acknowledges all the criticisms that Israel makes about the very character of the institution of UNRWA. But in the Palestinian perspective, this is a good thing. While many people who are classified today as Palestinian refugees were not alive in 1948, they nevertheless feel that it is their right to return to land on which their ancestors lived on many years previously. So in a sense, there’s quite a lot of common ground between the Israeli and Palestinian perspective of UNRWA. One side just thinks its existence is a bad thing, and the other thinks it’s a good thing. So I guess I get how this agency could symbolically represent a threat to Israel. But in reality, how much is this aid organization actually a threat to the state of Israel? I mean, how much are they actually working toward Palestinians getting to return to what is now Israel? Well, the claim is not that the leaders of UNRWA are going around directly mobilizing Palestinian refugees to return to Israel. A lot of the debate around UNRWA centers on what is taught in its schools. Huh. In Israel, it has not gone unnoticed that of the dozen people accused of participating in the October 7 attack, several of them were either teachers or workers in those schools. And the curricula in those schools have also come under tremendous Israeli scrutiny. In one case, researchers highlighted how a textbook glorified a Palestinian militant who was involved in a terror attack on Israeli civilians in the 1970s, called Dalal Mughrabi. And in other cases, Israeli researchers have highlighted maps of Palestine published in textbooks used in UNRWA’s schools that do not include the state of Israel. UNRWA has, in some cases, acknowledged these criticisms and has said it’s taken action to withdraw those particular materials from circulation. And Palestinians, for their part, also make similar criticisms of the Israeli education system, where you often see maps of Israel that don’t include the West Bank or Gaza or assume that the West Bank is part of the state of Israel. And Palestinians, in general, point out that the education system that is provided in UNRWA’s schools in other parts of the Palestinian education system is of a fairly good standard. The literacy rate among Palestinians stands at 95 percent, which is nearly 10 points higher than the global average. The other major criticism that Israelis make about UNRWA is that it somehow turns a blind eye to Hamas militant activity, that Hamas or other militant groups have stored ammunition inside UNRWA facilities or have fired rockets from very close to UNRWA schools, or even dug tunnels underneath its buildings. And UNRWA says that when it finds out about this, it takes action, and has even publicized some of these transgressions itself, and that ultimately, it can’t do much if people fire rockets from close to its schools. It’s not an armed institution and has no means of combating that. So for the critics of UNRWA, the idea is basically that UNRWA is supporting the Hamas agenda, which is, of course, the destruction of Israel through propaganda, and then looking the other way when Hamas uses their facilities for war. But UNRWA’s saying, we don’t have a military to stop any of this stuff. We’re just trying to provide services the best we can in an extremely difficult environment. Yes. And that’s why an allegation like the ones we’ve been hearing in recent days have been so damaging. Because it suggests that UNRWA isn’t just an institution working within a difficult environment, but that it has been infiltrated by people who are members of the group that the UN is saying it’s independent from. So I have to imagine that people who’ve been making these accusations all of these years are feeling pretty satisfied that these allegations have come to light and are being seen by the world and taken seriously by the world. I think, yes and no. Some people are delighted. They’re saying we’ve always said this, and finally, these ideas are getting prime time. Others may agree fundamentally that UNRWA is this nefarious organization, but they don’t feel this is the time to try and bring it down, because as much as they dislike the premise of what UNRWA stands for, they recognize that it plays a huge and important role in sustaining life, ultimately, during a devastating war that has killed roughly 1 in 100 Gazans, according to Gazan official estimates. And they don’t have a plan for what could replace UNRWA and who could step in, who has the manpower and the logistical footprint to deliver aid to provide shelter. And there are fears that if UNRWA collapses, it would hugely worsen what is already a very dire humanitarian situation. Right. I’ve spoken to Israeli officials and former officials, and they see it as part of a lack of strategic planning on the part of the Israeli government, which is avoiding very difficult questions about what Israel wants to see in Gaza after the war ends. And for some of them, it’s also exactly the wrong thing to be doing at a time when Israel stands accused of genocide, and in particular, when the world’s highest court, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, has just ordered Israel to prevent genocide, in part by increasing more aid to Gaza. And on the same day that that order was made, we instead see a number of countries start pulling funding for the biggest aid operation in the Gaza Strip, which raises questions about whether, in fact, we’ll see less aid rather than more. Right. Obviously, the question of aid is most critical to the ongoing struggle of Gazans to simply survive this war. But for Israel, the idea that the main aid agency in Gaza would be hobbled, and therefore, the humanitarian crisis there would get worse, is both a practical problem, but also a problem for how the world sees Israel in this moment. Absolutely. It’s a perception problem for Israel, but it’s also a perception problem for many of the Western countries, including the United States, who were the first to pull funding for UNRWA as this scandal broke. If Israel has a reputation problem as a result of this war, so, too, does the United States and the Biden administration, because of its support for Israel, and its own reputation and perceptions of its intentions are also wrapped up in Israel’s fate and Gaza’s. Yeah, it’s a very tricky situation for the US and other funders. On the one hand, they don’t want to be perceived as having anything to do with anyone who has anything to do with Hamas. On the other hand, they also don’t want to be seen as being responsible in any way for this humanitarian crisis — one that will get worse if the one real aid organization goes away. Exactly. But we have seen attempts by US officials to cast the suspension in a different light. We’ve seen stories come out saying that actually, the US was not due to send more funding for a while and that the last remaining tranche of the funding it was supposed to provide in this particular funding cycle was minimal, and that in essence, the suspension was more of a symbolic move than one that would actually have practical effect on UNRWA’s budget. So kind of trying to walk it back a bit. Exactly. All that said, while the US is the main funder or the largest funder of UNRWA, the collective effect of all the other suspensions from more than a dozen other countries could well be damaging enough to leave UNRWA in major trouble. And according to UNRWA, it could go out of business, they say, by the end of the month, because there are so many other suspensions of funding from other sources. So actually, many in Israel, the US, and countries around the world, and most of all, Gazans, are aligned in having pretty serious interest in UNRWA not collapsing right now. Exactly. And the key words there are “right now.” While this war goes on, certainly, there is a strange and perhaps surprising alignment of interests, if not motives. Right. In the long term, of course, there remain profound disagreements, not only about the future of UNRWA but the future of Gaza and who should govern it, what role should Hamas play, what role should Israel play, what role should other Palestinian leaders play, and of course, what role should UNRWA play, and should it play any role at all. Israel wants to see a completely different architecture of aid agencies and aid distribution. Others think it’s entirely the wrong time to be discussing revamping the aid system in a territory where more than 80 percent of people are displaced, more than half the buildings are damaged or destroyed, and 1 in 100 people has been killed. Patrick, thank you. Thank you, Sabrina. The “Times” reports that UNRWA is set to lose at least $65 million by the end of February as funding cuts made by donors begin to kick in. In all, 18 states or institutions announced suspensions of funding. Some, like the United States, had already made scheduled payments, but others, including Finland, Germany, Japan, and Sweden, had not and are now set to miss them. We’ll be right back.

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise, and this is “The Daily.” We turn now to Israel, where a growing list of countries around the world have suspended funding to a UN Refugee Agency for Palestinians. Israel has now shared its intelligence, claiming at least 13 UN aid workers actually took part in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. Late last month, an explosive allegation that workers from a crucial UN relief agency in Gaza had taken part in the October 7 attacks stunned the world and prompted major donors, including the US, to suspend funding. Today, Jerusalem Bureau Chief Patrick Kingsley on what this could mean for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and how it might complicate Israel’s strategy in the war. It’s Tuesday, February 6. Patrick, hi. Hi, Sabrina. So the last time we talked, late last year, there was this growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Most of the population had been displaced. Disease and hunger were starting to emerge as bigger and bigger problems. Now, the situation has gotten worse. And in the midst of all of this, the main UN relief agency in Gaza, known as UNRWA, has been engulfed in scandal over accusations that some of its staff actually played a role in the October 7 attack. Yes. So tell me the story and what we know. What we know is this. On January 18, the head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini went to what was expected to be a routine meeting with a senior Israeli diplomat to discuss delivery of aid and fuel to Gaza, the supplies that UNRWA helps to coordinate. Instead, the Israeli diplomat dropped a bombshell accusation. He claimed that roughly a dozen employees of UNRWA had either participated in the Hamas-led raid on Israel on October 7 or, in one case, in its aftermath. Wow, so that is quite a bombshell. It’s a very serious allegation. This is just a small, tiny minority of the 13,000 employees of UNRWA in Gaza. But nevertheless, it’s too many, and certainly, not what you expect of a UN agency that is devoted to neutrality and humanitarianism. Right. So actually, tell us what this agency does in Gaza. UNRWA is the main aid organization for Palestinians that is run by the United Nations. In times outside war, it provides education and primary health care for roughly five million Palestinians across the Middle East, including more than a million in Gaza itself. It runs hundreds of schools and provides education for roughly 300,000 Gazan children. Since the war has begun, it has been the primary supplier of shelter to displaced Palestinians. More than half the population is now living in an UNRWA facility. Its schools and other facilities have provided a roof over the head of some 1.2 million Gazans since the start of the war. A crucial organization, especially in this moment. Yes, absolutely. And after that meeting with the senior Israeli diplomat, Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, begins to fire nine of the employees who are accused of participating in the attack. Two of them, we believe, are already dead, and at least one of them in the attack itself. Then, the UN starts to tell the donor states that provide UNRWA with most of its funding — chief among them, the United States. And that led to senior American diplomats being briefed on the claims, and they were presented by Israeli officials with a dossier outlining these claims. On that same day, UNRWA decided to announce to the world that these allegations had been made against some of their employees and that some of them had already been fired. Now, the UN has fired nine UNRWA members. We understand two more are being looked into. And that news led the United States, and then a cascade of more than a dozen other countries, to suspend their funding for UNRWA, pending further investigation. The US has paused funding to the UN agency that is actually providing aid to the Palestinians. Canada announced it, too, has temporarily paused any additional — The latest to halt aid being Germany — Japan and Austria became the latest countries to suspend payments. And this came on the same day — — hours after the UN’s top court ordered Israel to take measures to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza. — that the International Court of Justice in The Hague had ruled that in order to prevent a genocide, Israel needed to supply more aid to Gaza. And so at a time when more aid was supposed to be coming in to Gaza, the UN’s biggest aid agency was running the risk of collapse. The head of UNRWA is calling for all those nations who are suspending funding right now to change their minds. Given the desperate plight of so many, this would be a heavy blow if UNRWA’s operations were suspended in some way. And indeed, we’ve been told by UNRWA’s leadership that if the funds aren’t restored by the end of February, it will struggle to operate. That could have grave implications for the distribution of aid and the provision of shelter to more than a million Gazans, just at the wrong time, just as we’re told that famine is looming in parts of Gaza. More than half the buildings in Gaza are damaged or destroyed, according to UN estimates, and around 2 million people out of 2.2 million have been displaced. So it couldn’t be happening, this convergence of events, at a worse time. Right. An already bad situation is likely to get a lot worse for Gazans. Yes, exactly. What were the actual charges, Patrick? I mean, what did you learn about that? Well, to begin with, it really wasn’t clear what the specific allegations were. We had this statement from UNRWA saying that there were claims against various employees. There was talk of a dossier. But no one was releasing any information. So what me and our colleague, Ronen Bergman, did — we spent the weekend calling up as many sources as we could reach, trying to find out exactly what this dossier had said. And two days after the allegations broke, we finally got our hands on the dossier itself. And what it alleged was shocking. It said that, for example, one of the employees, a teacher, had been involved in a raid on the Israeli village of Be’eri, where roughly 100 people were killed during the October 7 attack. It said another person was involved in the kidnapping of a woman. It said that a third person was involved in the capture of a soldier’s corpse on October 7, and so on and so on. The list went on. The dossier said the information was mainly taken from wiretaps of people’s phones and also through the geolocation of people’s phones on the day of October 7. We could only confirm the identity of one of the people accused, but we had no way of verifying the material ourselves. All we knew was that UNRWA had decided themselves to take action, both firing nine people and announcing the news publicly. And that wasn’t all. The dossier also had another claim, an even bigger claim, that had not previously been reported. And that was that according to the Israeli military, roughly 1/10 of UNRWA’s staff of 13,000 inside Gaza were affiliated or members of Hamas and other militant factions. Wow.

An Israeli soldier gives a thumbs up to the camera as he drives a bulldozer down a street in Beit Lahia, in northern Gaza, pushing a battered car toward a half-collapsed building. “I stopped counting how many neighborhoods I’ve erased,” the caption reads on the video posted to his personal TikTok, accompanied by a militaristic anthem. Since Israel’s invasion in October, soldiers have shared videos from Gaza on social media, offering a rare, unsanctioned look at operations on the ground. Some have been viewed by small circles of people; others have reached tens of thousands. The New York Times reviewed hundreds of these videos. Some show unremarkable parts of a soldier’s life — eating, hanging out or sending messages to loved ones back home. Others capture soldiers vandalizing local shops and school classrooms, making derogatory comments about Palestinians, bulldozing what appear to be civilian areas and calling for the building of Israeli settlements in Gaza, an inflammatory idea that is promoted by some far-right Israeli politicians.

"UNRWA Set to Lose $65 Million, Documents Show",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/world/middleeast/unrwa-funds-gaza-aid.html,2024-02-05T22:10:53+0000,"The agency, which plays a key role in the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, has received an influx of private donations but not enough to make up for the loss of international funding.","The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the main aid agency in Gaza, is set to lose $65 million by the end of February as donors’ funding cuts begin to kick in, according to internal accounting documents reviewed by The New York Times.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement The agency, which plays a key role in the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, has received an influx of private donations but not enough to make up for the loss of international funding. ByPatrick Kingsley The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the main aid agency in Gaza, is set to lose $65 million by the end of February as donors’ funding cuts begin to kick in, according to internal accounting documents reviewed by The New York Times. At least 18 states or institutions, includingmany of the agency’s biggest funders, announced they were suspending their donations to the agency, known as UNRWA, afteraccusations emerged last month that several employees participated in the Hamas-led attackon Israel on Oct. 7. Some of those suspensions will take time to take effect. Countries deliver their donations at intervals throughout the year, and some of the countries were not scheduled to make their payments for several months. For example, the United States had already made the first of its three installments in January, and the second U.S. payment is not due until May, according to the documents. But Finland missed a payment of $5.4 million in January, and three more countries — Germany, Japan and Sweden — are set to miss payments throughout February that are collectively worth almost $60 million. Because UNRWA has no significant reserves, the shortfall means the agency will have no funds of its own in March to pay its 30,000 workers across the Middle East, of which 13,000 are in Gaza, according to Tamara Alrifai, a spokeswoman for UNRWA. The agency could bridge the gap by applying for a loan from a centralized U.N. reserve, Ms. Alrifai said. UNRWA’s operation plays a critical role in the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. More than 80 percent of Gaza’s 2.2 million people have been displaced by the war, and more than half of the population are now sheltering in repurposed schools and centers run by the agency. UNRWA also oversees the distribution of the meager supplies of aid that arrive each day to Gaza by truck. Already, aid agencies are warning of famine amid profound food shortages and the collapse of the health care system. Since donor states began suspending their funds, the agency has received an unusually high number of private donations from individual citizens seeking to fill the void. In the five days after the allegations surfaced, Ms. Alrifai said, UNRWA received roughly $5 million from private donors — more than the agency would typically receive from individuals during any single month. But the donations are not enough to fund the agency for more than a few days: It has an annual budget of more than $1.5 billion, Ms. Alrifai said. Patrick Kingsleyis the Jerusalem bureau chief, covering Israel and the occupied territories. He has reported from more than 40 countries, written two books and previously covered migration and the Middle East for The Guardian.More about Patrick Kingsley Advertisement",The New York Times

ByDeclan WalshandSamar Abu Elouf Photographs bySamar Abu Elouf Samar Abu Elouf, a photojournalist, spent weeks documenting five Palestinians in Gaza whose lives had been shattered by the war. Declan Walsh is an international correspondent for The New York Times. A toddler, a 12-year-old, a mother, a photojournalist. Their lives were ripped apart in one of the deadliest andmost destructive wars of the 21st century. Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, now in its fourth month, is often conveyed in stark numbers and historical comparisons: Some 27,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza health ministry. Nearly two million are displaced andmore than 60 percent of residential buildingshave been damaged or destroyed. Yet the lives behind those statistics are often hidden from view. Internet and cellphone services are frequently cut; international reporters cannot enter Gaza except on escorted trips with the Israeli military; and dozensof Palestinian journalists have been killedin a military campaign prompted by the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. Samar Abu Elouf, a photojournalist for The New York Times, spent weeks following a handful of Palestinians who seemed to have lost everything: a boy with charred limbs, a journalist who lost four of his children in an Israeli strike, an orphaned toddler who may never walk again. Then The Times evacuated Ms. Abu Elouf and her family in December as the Israeli ground offensive extended across southern Gaza. Since then, Gaza hasspiraled toward famine. Some residents say they are eating grass and animal feed to survive. Giant bombs fall near the last functioning hospitals. Torrential rainspound disease-ridden tent camps.

She was the sole survivor. ByRaja Abdulrahim The post by the Palestine Red Crescent was a haunting plea, hoping to learn the fate of three people not heard from for five days. “Where is Hind? Where are Ahmed and Yousef? We need to know,” it said. Two of the group’s rescuers were dispatched on Monday to find 6-year-old Hind Rajab, believed to be trapped in a vehicle in northern Gaza with a number of dead family members. The Red Crescent said one of its workers had spoken extensively by phone with Hind on Monday and that it believed that all six of her relatives inside the vehicle with her had been killed that same day by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said it was not aware of the incident. The Red Crescent said in a statement on Saturday evening, “118 hours have passed, and the fate of the PRCS ambulance team, Yousef Zeino and Ahmed al Madhoun, who went to rescue the 6-year-old girl, Hind, remains unknown.” It was the latest in a series of desperate posts the aid organization has put out daily since the rescuers went missing, counting the hours since their disappearance in an effort to draw attention to the plight of all three. The Red Crescent said a response coordinator, Rana al-Faqeh, had spoken to Hind for more than three hours on Monday afternoon, trying to soothe the frightened child.

ByRoni Caryn RabinandRami Nazzal Roni Caryn Rabin reported from Tel Aviv, and Rami Nazzal from Al-Mazra’a ash Sharqiyeh, West Bank. Family members of a Palestinian American teenager who was fatally shot in the occupied West Bank demanded on Saturday that the authorities find the killer of the 17-year-old, who was hit by a barrage of gunfire, his cousin said, as the two were setting out to have a picnic near their village. The death of the teenager, whom the family identified as Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, came as tensions have been rising between Israel and the United States. The State Department confirmed that an American was killed in the West Bank on Friday without releasing identification and called on Israel to provide more information about the death. Without naming the teenager or confirming his death, the Israeli police said in a statement on Saturday that they were investigating the shooting. The police said that an Israeli civilian and an off-duty policeman had fired at “individuals purportedly engaged in rock-throwing activities.” The Israeli Army was investigating whether a soldier was also involved in the shooting, according to a military spokesman. The military and the police did not respond to requests for comment beyond their initial statements. A distant cousin, Mohammad Ejak, 16, said Tawfic was shot while driving to a grove of olive trees owned by the family, about a 15-minute drive from their village, Al-Mazra’a ash Sharqiyeh, near Ramallah. “We did not throw any rocks at anyone’s car, and we didn’t even get out of our own car before the shots were fired at us,” said a visibly shaken Mohammad, who attended Tawfic’s funeral on Saturday. Mohammad said he did not know where the gunshots came from and ducked below the dashboard when he heard the gunfire. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"As Face of Biden’s Israel Policy, Blinken Draws Wrath of Gaza War Protesters",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/politics/blinken-gaza-protests.html,2024-02-03T10:03:40+0000,Demonstrators have turned up at the secretary of state’s home and even splashed fake blood on his motorcade.,"For Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, the conflict in Gaza has come home.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by Demonstrators have turned up at the secretary of state’s home and even splashed fake blood on his motorcade. ByMichael Crowley Reporting from Washington For Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, the conflict in Gaza has come home. Protesters angry over Israel’s assault on Gaza have become a regular presence outside Mr. Blinken’s residence in Northern Virginia, with some camping out for days in roadside tents. Palestinian flags and handmade signs express their fury at a diplomat who has become the face of President Biden’s policy toward the conflict. “Bloody Blinken lives here,” read one this week. “Caution: War Criminal Inside,” read another. Passing cars drove over the words “Secretary of genocide” scrawled along the road in pastel chalk colors. And when Mr. Blinken’s official motorcade pulled out of his driveway one day in early January, protesters splashed fake blood on the armored black Suburban in which he was riding. Organizers of the protests have even given their effort a name, “Occupy Blinken,” and said in a statement that their encampment has held more than 100 people. (On Thursday afternoon perhaps two dozen were visible, along with numerous police officers and vehicles.) They have “braved cold temperatures, winds and rain, 24 hours a day, to plead with Blinken” to support an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, the statement said. Some neighbors are unhappy about the commotion on their typically serene street, according to one. A digital traffic sign imported by police warns drivers to slow down and instructs “NO HORN BLOWING,” suggesting that expressions of support have created unwelcome noise in an area that is also home to at least two ambassadors from Persian Gulf countries. For Mr. Blinken, it is surely a startling turn of events. For much of the past two years he has been a hero in many quarters of the United States and Europe for championing the defense of Ukraine and demanding accountability for Russian war atrocities. Now he is condemned by protesters who are furious that the Biden administration has provided military hardware and political cover for what they call a morally outrageous and even criminal Israeli response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, which has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials.

The 8 Days That Roiled the U.N.’s Top Agency in Gaza,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/world/middleeast/united-nations-gaza-unrwa.html,2024-02-03T12:22:39+0000,"The crisis that threatens the future of the main United Nations agency in Gaza, amid a humanitarian disaster, began at a routine meeting between diplomats in Tel Aviv.","When a senior U.S. diplomat called the Israeli military last week to request further details about Israeli allegations against a United Nations agency in Gaza, military leaders were so surprised that they ordered an internal inquiry about how the information had reached the ears of foreign officials.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by The crisis that threatens the future of the main United Nations agency in Gaza, amid a humanitarian disaster, began at a routine meeting between diplomats in Tel Aviv. ByPatrick KingsleyandRonen Bergman Patrick Kingsley reported from Jerusalem, and Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv. When a senior U.S. diplomat called the Israeli military last week to request further details about Israeli allegations against a United Nations agency in Gaza, military leaders were so surprised that they ordered an internal inquiry about how the information had reached the ears of foreign officials. The allegations were grave: 12 employees of the organization, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, were accused of joining Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel or its aftermath. The claims reinforced Israel’s decades-old narrative about UNRWA: that it is biased against Israel and influenced by Hamas and other armed groups, charges that the agency strongly rejects. But while most Israeli officials oppose UNRWA, some military leaders did not want to see it shuttered amid a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. In fact, it was not the military that disclosed the information to the United States but UNRWA itself. The sequence of events began on Jan. 18, when Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, met with a top Israeli diplomat in Tel Aviv. Mr. Lazzarini meets roughly once a month in Israel with the diplomat, Amir Weissbrod, a deputy director general at the Israeli Foreign Ministry who oversees relationships with U.N. agencies. This was meant to be a routine discussion about the delivery of food, fuel and other aid supplies to Gaza, according to a U.N. official briefed on the meeting. Instead, Mr. Weissbrod came supplied with the shocking intelligence about UNRWA, which had been given to him by officers in the military, according to four officials familiar with the situation.

ByAaron Boxerman,Nick Cumming-BruceandThomas Fuller Aaron Boxerman reported from Jerusalem, Nick Cumming-Bruce from Geneva and Thomas Fuller from San Francisco. Israel’s defense minister has signaled that ground forces will advance toward the city of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, which has become a refuge for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians pushed from their homes by nearly 13 weeks of war. Rafah, which has also been a gateway for humanitarian aid, is a sprawl of tents and makeshift shelters crammed against the border with Egypt. About half of Gaza’s 2.2 million residents have piled into and around the city, where about 200,000 people lived before the war, the United Nations said on Friday. The city is one of the last in southern Gaza that Israeli ground forces, which have been fighting house-to-house battles in nearby Khan Younis, have not yet reached. “We are completing the mission in Khan Younis and we will reach Rafah, as well, and eliminate every terrorist there who threatens to harm us,” the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said during a visit to troops in Khan Younis, according to footage distributed by his office late Thursday. The prospect of battles in an area with so many displaced people has alarmed refugees there and United Nations officials. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

What Withholding Funds to UNRWA Means for Gaza,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/world/middleeast/how-unwra-funds-in-gaza.html,2024-02-02T22:18:54+0000,"After 12 employees of the U.N. agency were accused of participating in the Oct. 7 attack against Israel, some donor countries have suspended funding.

But more than a million people in Gaza depend on the agency for aid. ByAdam Rasgon Reporting from Jerusalem The main United Nations agency that provides food and services to Palestinians in the beleaguered Gaza Strip warned this week that it could soon run out of money after at least a dozen countries temporarily suspended funding amid accusations that some agency employees participated in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel. The agency, known as UNRWA, receives hundreds of millions of dollars annually to aid Palestinians in Gaza, and it provides needed services in which the Hamas government has shown little interest, including operating schools and maintaining health clinics. Since the start of the war, UNRWA has coordinated the distribution of relief to Gazans suffering from displacement, hunger and illness. “Withdrawing funds from UNRWA is perilous and would result in the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza,” U.N. officials said in a statement on Wednesday. Here’s a closer look at how the agency, formally the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, spends its funds. UNRWA operates across the Middle East, providing aid and services to Palestinian refugees, but it employs the most people in Gaza, where 1.7 million refugees resided before the war. The bulk of UNRWA’s regular budget for Gaza goes to pay the salaries of 13,000 employees, including teachers, health care specialists, engineers and sanitation workers. The bill for salaries and operational expenses comes out to $30 million monthly, according to Juliette Touma, the director of communications for the agency.

Over 800 Officials in U.S. and Europe Sign Letter Protesting Israel Policies,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/us/politics/protest-letter-israel-gaza.html,2024-02-02T11:00:09+0000,The document was signed by government employees in 12 nations and E.U. institutions.

Signers say their leaders’ policies could be contributing to war crimes in Gaza. ByEdward WongandMatina Stevis-Gridneff Edward Wong reported from Washington, and Matina Stevis-Gridneff from Brussels. More than 800 officials in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union released apublic letter of dissenton Friday against their governments’ support of Israel in itswar in Gaza. The letter is the first instance of officials in allied nations across the Atlantic coming together to openly criticize their governments over the war, say current and former officials who are organizing or supporting the effort. The officials say that it is their duty as civil servants to help improve policy and to work in their nations’ interests, and that they are speaking up because they believe their governments need to change direction on the war. The signers say they have raised concerns through internal channels but have been ignored. “Our governments’ current policies weaken their moral standing and undermine their ability to stand up for freedom, justice and human rights globally,” the letter says, according to a copy obtained Thursday by The New York Times. It adds that “there is a plausible risk that our governments’ policies are contributing to grave violations of international humanitarian law, war crimes and even ethnic cleansing or genocide.” The Israeli military launched a bombing and ground campaign in Gaza after Hamas fighters invaded Israel on Oct. 7 and killed about 1,200 people while abducting about 240, Israeli officials said. More than 27,000 people in Gaza have been killed and nearly 2 million have been displaced since Israel’s offensive began, according to the health ministry in Gaza and United Nations officials. The document does not include the names of signers because they fear reprisal, said one organizer, an official who has worked in the State Department for more than two decades. But about 800 current officials have given approval to the letter as it has quietly circulated among employees at the national level in multiple countries, the official said.

ByJohnatan Reiss,Gaya GuptaandNatan Odenheimer President Bidenimposed financial sanctionson Thursday against four Israelis accused of escalating violence against civilians, intimidating civilians or destroying property in the West Bank. Ina statement, the State Department said, “The United States has consistently opposed actions that undermine stability in the West Bank and the prospects of peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike.” Here’s what we know about the four men, who range in age from 21 to 32. Mr. Chasdai led a riot on the Palestinian town of Huwara, the State Department said, which resulted in the death of a Palestinian civilian.The New York Times reportedon a rampage in Huwara and neighboring villages on Feb. 26, 2023, that started after two settlers were shot and killed. Israeli settlers burned and vandalized homes, businesses and vehicles, and one Palestinian was killed. Reached by phone on Friday, Mr. Chasdai’s mother, Dafna Chasdai, dismissed the impact of the sanctions, saying that the family does not have relatives in the United States and that the “whole thing is a joke.” After the Huwara violence, Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister,signed an administrative detention warrant— a policy of indefinite imprisonment without trial that Israel almost exclusively uses against Palestinians — for Mr. Chasdai, according to the Israeli news media. A few days later, a courtshortened his detentionby a month. He was sentenced to six months in jail in 2016 for planning to carry out an attack, when he and another person were found outside Beit Iksa, a Palestinian village, with fuel bottles and a club.

ByMichael D. Shear Reporting from Clinton Township, Mich. President Biden on Thursday ordered broad financial and travel sanctions on Israeli settlers accused of violent attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank, a forceful gesture aimed in part at Arab American voters in the United States who have expressed fury about the president’s backing of Israel’s war in Gaza. Mr. Biden authorized the sanctions with an executive order that goes further than a directive issued in December by the State Department, whichimposed visa banson dozens of Israeli settlers who have committed acts of violence in the West Bank. The sanctions will initially be imposedon four Israelis, who will be cut off from the U.S. financial system and from accessing any American assets or property. They also will be prevented from traveling to the United States or engaging in any commerce with people in the United States. For Mr. Biden, the order served a dual purpose: It was a sharp diplomatic notice to Israel’s government at a time when the United States is pressing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for restraint. But it also sent a message to Arab Americans, a key part of the political coalition he needs to be re-elected, that he is serious about using the power of the United States on behalf of the Palestinians. The White House announced the sanctions just hours before Mr. Biden held a campaign event in Michigan, a critical battleground state that has a large Arab American population and has been the site of numerous protests over the war in Gaza. The executive order comes after years of American frustration with Israeli settlers, whom they view as a source of violence and instability and a threat to a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. And it comes as Mr. Biden faces growing criticism over U.S. support for Israel’s war in Gaza, including from members of his own party. American officials fear arecent surge in attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestiniansin the West Bank could set off even wider violence, making an already combustible situation worse. “This violence poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,” said Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser.

ByPatrick Kingsley To understand Benjamin Netanyahu’s bind, Patrick Kingsley spoke to the Israeli prime minister’s allies, critics and biographers, including five lawmakers from his party. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is fighting two parallel battles, one in Gaza and another at home — and neither is going according to plan. In Gaza, Mr. Netanyahu is leading a military campaign to defeat Hamas and free the remaining Israeli hostages captured during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. At home, he is fighting to secure both his short-term political survival and his long-term legacy. On both fronts, he is struggling. In Gaza, more than 100 hostages remain captive despite months of war and protracted negotiations for their release. Hamas is battered but undefeated, and generals have privately said that the war, despite devastating Gaza and killing more than 26,000 people, according to officials there, is approaching a deadlock. In Israel, polls show the prime minister would easily lose an election if one were held tomorrow. And after Mr. Netanyahu presided over the defense failures on Oct. 7, the deadliest day in Israel’s history, his legacy has been ruined. His efforts to resolve these crises are at odds with each other, analysts said. To burnish his legacy, he is pushing for a landmark peace deal with Saudi Arabia, a long-term strategic goal for Israel. Saudi Arabia, however, will not normalize ties without an Israeli commitment to a two-state solution. And without greater cooperation from Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies, it will become harder for Israel to wind down its war in Gaza and plan for the territory’s future. But to retain power and preserve his right-wing coalition, he must reject the premise of a Palestinian state. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByFarnaz Fassihi Iran’s Supreme National Security Council held an emergency meeting this week, deeply worried that the United States would retaliate after an Iran-aligned militia in Iraq killed three American soldiers and wounded more than 40 others in Jordan. The council, including the president, foreign minister, chiefs of the armed forces and two aides to the country’s supreme leader, debated how to respond to a range of possibilities, from a U.S. attack on Iran, itself, to strikes against the proxy militias that Iran backs in the region, according to three Iranians with knowledge of the council’s deliberations who were not authorized to speak publicly. They relayed the plans developed at the Monday meeting to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the people familiar with the discussion said, and he responded with clear orders: avoid a direct war with the United States and distance Iran from the actions of proxies who had killed Americans — but prepare to hit back if the United States struck Iran. For a repressive, widely unpopular government already struggling with aweak economy,outbursts of mass protestandterrorism, direct conflict with the United States risks not only death and destruction in Iran. It could threaten the theocratic regime’s grip on power. By Wednesday high-level Iranian officials, including the foreign minister and ambassador to the United Nations, were publicly proclaiming the stance set out by Mr. Khamenei, trying to reassure Iranians anxious about the prospect of war, and to temper the response by President Biden, who haspromised retaliationin the coming days.

But, unexpectedly, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White indicated that he would have preferred to have issued the injunction were he not limited by the Constitution, and he implored the Biden administration to “examine the results of their unflagging support” of Israel. The determination came five days after ahearing in Oakland, Calif., in which Judge White allowed the head of a humanitarian group, a medical intern and three Palestinian Americans with relatives in Gaza to tell the court that their loved ones were being slaughtered. They alleged that the U.S. government has underwritten a genocide by backing Israel’s military response to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. “President Biden could, with one phone call, put an end to this,” Laila el-Haddad,a Palestinian activist and author living in Maryland, told the judge. She said that Israeli attacks had killed at least 88 members of her extended family in Gaza. “My family is being killed on my dime.” Judge White, who last week had called the testimony “gut-wrenching,” wrote that the evidence and testimony “indicate that the ongoing military siege in Gaza is intended to eradicate a whole people.” But, he added, “there are rare cases in which the preferred outcome is inaccessible to the court.” This, he wrote, was such a case: “It is every individual’s obligation to confront the current siege in Gaza, but it is also this Court’s obligation to remain within the metes and bounds of its jurisdictional scope.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Chicago Passes Gaza Cease-Fire Resolution in Israel-Hamas War,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/world/middleeast/chicago-israel-ceasefire-gaza-resolution.html,2024-01-31T21:51:45+0000,"The passions ignited by the war in Gaza have reverberated through American politics, but the issue has been particularly contentious in Chicago and its suburbs.","The Chicago City Council voted on Wednesday to approve a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas, making it the largest city in the United States to do so.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement The passions ignited by the war in Gaza have reverberated through American politics, but the issue has been particularly contentious in Chicago and its suburbs. ByColbi Edmonds The Chicago City Council voted on Wednesday to approve a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas, making it the largest city in the United States to do so. Mayor Brandon Johnson broke a 23-to-23 tie to ensure passage of the resolution. Before the council discussion, residents and activists spoke passionately about their support of a cease-fire, cheering and clapping for their peers. Mr. Johnson at one point cleared the council chamber to lower the volume of dissent while Debra Silverstein, the council’s only Jewish member, spoke in opposition to the resolution. Similar debates have played out in communities nationwide as the passions ignited by the war in Gaza have reverberated through American politics. But the issue has been particularly contentious in Chicago and its suburbs. On Tuesday, hundreds of Chicago Public School studentswalked out of classin support of the resolution. “You serve a county that is home to the largest population of Palestinians in America, Palestinians who have been here because they were exiled for the last 75 years,” a resident said during the public-comment session that preceded the council discussion and vote. “For four months, you’ve heard us loud and clear, and it’s a shame that it’s taken this long.” The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, the civil rights activist, attended the meeting in support of the resolution. He is one of many Black religious leadersacross the countrywho have called on President Biden for a cease-fire. Alderman Daniel La Spata, a sponsor on the resolution, acknowledged on Wednesday that the city’s vote would not directly affect international policy. “We vote with solidarity,” Mr. La Spata said. “We vote to help people feel heard in a world of silence.” But despite the emotions surrounding the issue, council members held a largely restrained and respectful discussion. “I think some of the arguments here on the floor defy some logic,” Alderman Byron Sigcho-Lopez said, adding: “We all want peace, as we said, but how can we want peace and be against cease-fire?” The topic has been contentious among city leadership since the Oct. 7 attacks. Ms. Silverstein won passage of a resolution condemning Hamas a week after the attack, and on Wednesday she lamented that similar language was not part of this resolution as well. “We all want an end to the bloodshed and an end to the war,” Ms. Silverstein said during Wednesday’s meeting. “But it is vital to understand what caused the conflict, and we should pass a resolution that addresses the issue responsibly.” Around 70 citiesin the country, including San Francisco, Seattle and Detroit, have passed resolutions on the war, with at least 47 of those calling for an immediate cease-fire, according to Reuters.

I call for a rapid, safe and immediate, expanded and sustained humanitarian access throughout Gaza.” “UNRWA’s life-saving services to over three-quarters of Gaza’s residents should not be jeopardized by the allegations — alleged actions of a few individuals. It is a matter of extraordinary disproportion.” Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, stressed on Wednesday that the funding pause for the agency was temporary and praised the agency’s work, comments that suggested an appetite could exist among donors to resolve the funding crisis. “We know that this agency provides lifesaving services under incredibly challenging circumstances in Gaza and it contributes to regional stability and security,” Ms. Thomas-Greenfield said at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday afternoon. “For this reason, and for the sake of millions of Palestinian civilians who depend on UNRWA’s services, it is vital that the U.N. take quick and decisive action to hold accountable anyone guilty of heinous actions and to strengthen oversight of UNRWA’s operations and begin to restore donor confidence.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

A crowd of approving Palestinian onlookers gathered.","Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times As the world focuses on the war in Gaza, pressure is mounting on the West Bank. Israelis and Palestinians live worlds apart, separated often by a single road — or roadblocks. They are united only by a sense of growing anger and resentment. Supported by One recent morning in Huwara, a Palestinian man maneuvered a front-end loader back and forth, clearing rocks and rubble that Israel Defense Forces soldiers had piled into a roadblock. Four young soldiers looked on, fingers tensed on triggers, as the machine’s claws heaved shattered masonry from clutching mud. A crowd of approving Palestinian onlookers gathered. The barrier, put in place to prevent access to a main street that has been a battleground over the past year, has infuriated the 7,000 inhabitants of this town in the northern West Bank, who are now accustomed to eking out survival as Israeli forces close stores and control their every movement. The mayor, Moin Damidi, told me that Huwara has become a ghost town. Surrounded by Israeli settlements and traversed by the major north-south highway, it has also become a center of violence. “The greater the pressure, the bigger the explosion,” he said. Jihad Odeh, a city official, pointed at the soldiers. They opened and closed the road 10 times in the past year, he said. “The roadblock is for the settlers, to make them feel comfortable on our main street.” Almost a year ago, aPalestinian militant shot and killed two settlers as they drove through Huwara. In response, settlers swarmed down from the adjacent hilltop settlement of Yitzhar. They burned cars, businesses and homes, killing at least one Palestinian and injuring many more. The I.D.F., nominally responsible for keeping order, did not prevent the riot, and in the aftermath many right-wing politicians celebrated it. Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s finance minister, called forHuwara to be “wiped out,”and not by lawless settlers — “the state of Israel should do it,” he said. In Huwara, Israeli soldiers are seen as the settlers’ army. Smotrich, under a coalition deal struck in early 2023 with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, oversees the administration of settler affairs in the West Bank. He himself lives in the West Bank, in a settlement called Kedumim, a 15-minute drive from Huwara. Israel’s minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, is also a settler who lives in a suburb of Hebron. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Northern Gaza:In December, the Israeli military said that it was nearing “full operational control” of the region. But fighting has flared up again, and on Sunday, powerful explosions lit up the night sky around Gaza City. The fighting this week made clear just how much of the enclave was still a battlefield.

Their team swept into the West Bank hospital brandishing rifles, took up positions by the waiting-room chairs, then entered a patient’s room and killed a Hamas commander. Fifteen minutes later they were gone. The raid on Tuesday took place as the Israeli military battled Hamas on multiple fronts: with the dramatic operation in the West Bank, renewed clashes in northern Gaza, and beneath the territory’s surface. The Israeli military confirmed for the first time on Tuesday that its engineers had begun pumping seawater into the vast Hamas tunnel network beneath Gaza. Israel’s latest efforts in the nearly four-month war came amid a renewed push by multiple peace brokers, including the United States, Israel, Qatar and Egypt, for an agreement to pause the fighting. The political chief of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, said on Tuesday that he was studying a proposal for a temporary cease-fire that had come out of talks between officials from those nations in Paris. But even as those talks continued behind closed doors, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted anew that Israel would continue fighting until it achieved “complete victory.” And the raid at the Ibn Sina Specialized Hospital in the northern West Bank city of Jenin suggested that Israel would continue chasing down Hamas leaders across the region. Israeli forces have tried to strike Hamas leaders and their allies both inside Gaza and outside the territory. Earlier this month, Hamasblamed Israelfor an explosion in Lebanon that killed its deputy political chief, and Iran accused Israel of an airstrike that killed senior Iranian military figures in Syria. Israeli forces have escalated efforts against Palestinian militant activity in the West Bank, arresting more than 2,980 Palestinians since the war began in near-daily raids, over 1,350 of them affiliated with Hamas, according to the Israeli military.

ByMichael Crowley Michael Crowley covers the State Department, and reported from Washington. The State Department downplayed the significance on Tuesday of its decision to pause funding for the main U.N. aid agency in Gaza, explaining that it had already provided virtually all the money allocated by Congress for that purpose and that the Biden administration hoped the matter could be resolved quickly. More than 99 percent of American dollars approved by Congress for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA, has been sent to the agency, the State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said on Tuesday. The State Departmentpaused the money “temporarily”on Friday after accusations by Israel that a dozen UNRWA employees participated in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, with some holding hostages within Gaza. At least 17 other donor nations have also suspended their funding to the agency,according tothe group U.N. Watch. Human rights groups and progressive Democrats in Congress have denounced the move, saying that it will deprive innocent Palestinians of desperately needed aid. But Mr. Miller said the State Department had sent all but $300,000 of about $121 million budgeted for UNRWA to the agency, suggesting that the near-term effect of the U.S. action within Gaza will be minor. U.S. officials suggested that the real question is how much more money Congress will be willing to approve for an agency that many Republicans condemn for what they call anti-Israel bias and Hamas sympathies. Underscoring that uncertainty, witnesses ata House subcommittee hearingon Tuesday denounced UNRWA and called for its restructuring or replacement. Israel’s government says thatat least 12 employees of the agency participated in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, and that UNRWA employs as many as 1,300 Hamas members. Israel estimates that the attack left roughly 1,200 people dead; another 240 people were taken hostage. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Israeli Military Confirms It Has Begun Flooding Hamas Tunnels,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/world/middleeast/israel-flooding-tunnels-hamas.html,2024-01-30T19:28:17+0000,"It is the first time the military has publicly acknowledged using the tactic, which the U.N. has warned could damage Gaza’s drinking water.","The Israeli military said Tuesday that it had begun pumping water into the vast network of tunnels beneath Gaza, which Hamas has used to launch attacks, store weapons and imprison Israeli hostages.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement It is the first time the military has publicly acknowledged using the tactic, which the U.N. has warned could damage Gaza’s drinking water. ByRonen Bergman The Israeli military said Tuesday that it had begun pumping water into the vast network of tunnels beneath Gaza, which Hamas has used to launch attacks, store weapons and imprison Israeli hostages. The military “has implemented new capabilities to neutralize underground terrorist infrastructure in the Gaza Strip by channeling large volumes of water into the tunnels,” the Israeli military said in a statement. The statement was the military’s first public acknowledgment that its engineers were flooding tunnels, a contentious strategy that some military officials have said is ineffective and that the U.N. has warned could damage Gaza’s drinking water and sewage systems. Even before the war started in October, Israeli military officials had warned that Hamas’s tunnels presented a major threat. In the months since Israel launched its ground offensive and started uncovering the underground network, military spokesmen have expressed surprise at the length, depth and quality of the tunnels. Some sections of the network are large enough to drive a truck through. Elsewhere, the military hasdiscovered underground chambersin which, they say, some of the 240 hostages taken to Gaza after the Hamas-led assault on Oct. 7 have been held. Senior Israeli defense officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, estimated this month that the underground network isbetween 350 and 450 miles— extraordinary figures for a territory that at its longest point is only 25 miles. Two of the officials said there are close to 5,700 separate shafts leading down to the tunnels. In December, after reports that the military had begun experimenting with flooding some tunnels in northern Gaza, a U.N. official in Gaza warned against it. “It will cause severe damage to the already fragile water and sewage infrastructure that’s in Gaza,” said Lynn Hastings, then the U.N.’s humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories. In its statement Tuesday the military said it had selected tunnels to flood after an “analysis of the soil characteristics and the water systems in the area to ensure that damage is not done to the area's groundwater.” The military began experimenting with flooding tunnels only after the war began, according to three military officials with knowledge of the effort, which was code-named Atlantis. The purpose was never to drown Hamas fighters taking refuge in the subterranean network, but rather to flush them out, the officials said. On the whole, however, the project has had limited success, the officials added. Despite large volumes of water being pumped, many of the tunnels are porous, resulting in seepage into the surrounding soil rather than a deluge through the passageways.

ByVivian Yee,Abu Bakr BashirandGaya Gupta To many people outside Gaza, the war flashes by as a doomscroll of headlines and casualty tolls and photos of screaming children, the bloody shreds of somebody else’s anguish. But the true scale of death and destruction is impossible to grasp, the details hazy and shrouded by internet and cellphone blackouts that obstruct communication, restrictions barring international journalists and the extreme, often life-threatening challenges of reporting as a local journalist from Gaza. There are pinholes in the murk, apertures such as the Instagram feeds of Gaza photographers and a small number of testimonies that slip through. With every passing week, however, the light dims as those documenting the war leave, quit or die. Reporting from Gaza has come to seem pointlessly risky to some local journalists, who despair of moving the rest of the world to act. “I survived death multiple times and put myself in danger” to document the war, Ismail al-Dahdouh, a Gaza reporter, wrote in an Instagram post this month to announce he was quitting journalism. Yet a world “that doesn’t know the meaning of humanity” had not acted to stop it. At least 76 Palestinian journalists have beenkilledin Gaza since Oct. 7, when Hamas led an attack on Israel and Israel responded by launching an all-out war. The Committee to Protect Journalists says more journalists and media workers — including essential support staff such as translators, drivers and fixers — have been killed in the past 16 weeks than in a whole year of any other conflict since 1992.

Their call came a day after the Israeli leader rebuffed U.S. efforts to pressure him into a two-state solution. ByPeter Baker Reporting from Washington President Biden pressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Friday to agree to the creation of a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza is over and raised options that would limit Palestinian sovereignty to make the prospect more palatable to Israel. Hoping to overcome Mr. Netanyahu’s strenuous resistance, Mr. Biden floated the possibility of a disarmed Palestinian nation that would not threaten Israel’s security. While there was no indication that Mr. Netanyahu would ease his opposition, which is popular with his fragile right-wing political coalition, Mr. Biden expressed optimism that they may yet find consensus. “There are a number of types of two-state solutions,” the president told reporters at the White House several hours after the call, their first in nearly a month amid tension over the war. “There’s a number of countries that are members of the U.N. that are still — don’t have their own militaries. Number of states that have limitations.” He added, “And so I think there’s ways in which this could work.” Asked what Mr. Netanyahu was open to, Mr. Biden said, “I’ll let you know.” But he rejected the notion that a so-called two-state solution is impossible as long as Mr. Netanyahu is in power — “no, it’s not” — and he brushed off the idea of imposing conditions on American security aid to Israel if the prime minister continues to resist. “I think we’ll be able to work something out,” Mr. Biden said. A day later, however, Mr. Netanyahu appeared not to have been swayed by Mr. Biden’s pitch. “I shall not compromise on full Israeli security control of the entire area west of Jordan River — and that is irreconcilable with a Palestinian state,” he said in a post on social media. The last time the two leaders were known to have talked was on Dec. 23, in a call that was laterdescribed as especially tense. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Barnes Reporting from Washington Representatives from four nations have agreed to have Qatar present a nascent framework to Hamas that proposes a six-week pause in the war in Gaza for Hamas toexchange some hostagesfor Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, officials say. The talks are at an early stage, and many details would need to be worked out if Hamas agrees to start building on the framework, they said. Qatar is presenting the proposal to the political leaders of Hamas, who would convey it to the group’s military leaders, who would then send a response. That process could take days or even longer, because the military leaders are in hiding in tunnels deep beneath Gaza. In the proposed framework, Hamas would release elderly hostages, women and children, if any are still being held and are alive, over the pause period of six weeks, said the officials, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive diplomacy. That would be the first of three potential phases of swaps. During a seven-day pause in November, many people in those categories were among more than 100 hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. But some remain in the hands of Hamas or other militant groups in Gaza. Some Israeli officials say the number of hostages who would qualify for the first release is 30 to 35, but that is an estimate and the negotiators do not know the actual number. It is unclear if female soldiers would be included in hostages released in the tranche being discussed. That could be worked out in negotiations of details, if the talks reach that stage. Hamas and other men from Gaza took about 240 people hostage in the terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, which also resulted in about 1,200 deaths, Israeli officials said. The retaliatory Israeli military campaign, with robust weapons support from the United States, has killed about 25,000 people in Gaza, according to health ministry officials there.

Details Emerge on U.N.

ByRonen BergmanandPatrick Kingsley The reporters reviewed intelligence documents related to the Israeli allegations and interviewed officials briefed on their contents. One is accused of kidnapping a woman. Another is said to have handed out ammunition. A third was described as taking part in the massacre at a kibbutz where 97 people died. And all were said to be employees of the United Nations aid agency that schools, shelters and feeds hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The accusations are contained in a dossier provided to the United States government that details Israel’s claims against a dozen employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency who, it says, played a role in the Hamas attacks against Israel on Oct. 7 or in their aftermath. The U.N. said on Friday that it had fired several employees after being briefed on the allegations. But little was known about the accusations until the dossier was reviewed on Sunday by The New York Times. The accusations are what prompted eight countries, including the United States, to suspend some aid payment to UNRWA, as the agency is known, even as war plunges Palestinians in Gaza into desperate straits. More than 26,000 people have been killed there and nearly two million displaced, according to Gazan and U.N. officials. The UNRWA workers have been accused of helping Hamas stage the attack that set off the war in Gaza, or of aiding it in the days after. Some 1,200 people in Israel were killed that day, Israeli officials say, and about 240 were abducted and taken to Gaza. U.N. officials initially said all 12 employees were fired, but on Sunday, the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said nine had been dismissed. Asked about Israel’s allegations on Sunday, UNRWA said that two of the 12 employees were dead but that it could not provide more information while the U.N.’s Office of Internal Oversight Services was still investigating.

Netanyahu Rebuffs U.S. Calls to Start Working Toward Palestinian Statehood,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/18/world/middleeast/netanyahu-palestinian-state-israel-gaza-war.html,2024-01-18T19:31:14+0000,The Biden administration and the Israeli government diverge sharply over how Gaza should be governed when the war ends.,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Thursday appeared to rule out a postwar peace process that would lead to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state, rebuffing calls from the United States and others to start working toward that goal.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement The Biden administration and the Israeli government diverge sharply over how Gaza should be governed when the war ends. ByAaron Boxerman reporting from Jerusalem Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Thursday appeared to rule out a postwar peace process that would lead to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state, rebuffing calls from the United States and others to start working toward that goal. “In any arrangement in the foreseeable future — with an arrangement or without one — Israel must have security control over all the territory west of the Jordan,” Mr. Netanyahu said at a news conference, referring to an area including occupied territory that Palestinians hope will one day become their independent state. “This clashes with the idea of sovereignty. What can you do?” The Biden administration and the Israeli government have diverged sharply over how Gaza will be governed when the fighting ends. President Biden and his top diplomat, Antony J. Blinken, have urged Israeli officials to move toward the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state. Mr. Biden has suggested thata “revitalized” Palestinian Authority, which is based in the West Bank, run a post-Hamas Gaza as an interim step toward that goal. But Israeli officials have repeatedly dismissed such calls, saying they are focused on the war in Gaza. On Thursday, Mr. Netanyahu told reporters he had rebuffed the latest exhortations. “I told this truth to our friends, the Americans, and I also blocked the attempt to impose a reality that would harm Israel’s security,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “The prime minister needs to be able to say no, even to our best friends.” Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said on Thursday that Hamas’s Oct. 7 surprise attack — which left 1,200 dead in Israel, according to Israeli officials — had left most Israelis more concerned about their immediate security than long-term peace.

ByMatthew Mpoke Bigg Israel’s accusations that a dozen United Nations workers in Gaza had participated in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks have prompted some donor nations to re-evaluate their commitments to the agency that provides food, water and other essential services to Palestinian civilians. The United Nations said on Friday that it had fired the accused workers from the agency, known asUNRWA, andopened an investigation. Some countries have responded by suspending funding to UNRWA, while others have said they will maintain their support. Here is a look the steps announced by some leading donors, ranked according to the amount they have pledged: United States:Suspending funding. The United States is the agency’s largest donor, having pledged $344 million in 2022. The State Department said in a statement that it was withholding less than $1 million that had been approved but not yet disbursed, and that it was pausing additional funding “while we review these allegations and the steps the United Nations is taking to address them.” Germany:Temporarily suspending all new funding pending the outcome of an investigation into the allegations against the UNRWA workers. Germany pledged $202 million to the agency in 2022. European Union: No plans to suspend funding. The European Union,which contributed 82 million euros to UNRWA in 2023, reiterated its support of the agency’s role in addressing the humanitarian crisis, and said it would make “upcoming funding decisions in light of the outcome of the investigation.” Norway:Continuing its funding, which was $34 million in 2022. Though it expresseddeep concernedover the allegations, Norway urged other donors to reflect on the consequences of cutting funding, saying: “We should not collectively punish millions of people.” Japan:Suspending funding“for the time being.” Turkey:Expressed concern that some countries hadcut off fundingand said the decisions, in response to “allegations against a few UNRWA staff, will primarily harm the Palestinian people.” Canada:Pausing additional funding pending an investigation into the allegations against the UNRWA workers. The Netherlands:Suspendingall funding “until the investigation is concluded.” Britain:Suspending funding. The British government said it was “appalled” by the allegations. Spain:Continuing funding. Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said Monday that “only a dozen of the 30,000” UNRWA employees had been accused of crimes. Australia:Saidit would “temporarily pause disbursement of recently announced funding.” Ireland:No plans to suspend funding. Ireland welcomed UNRWA’s decision to investigate and said the agency’s 13,000 employees in Gaza provide lifesaving assistance at “incredible personal cost” — noting that more than 100 UNRWA workers had been killed in the fighting. Austria:Temporarily suspending“all further payments” to UNRWA until the accusations are clarified. Finland:Suspending funding, saying that “we must make sure that not a single euro of Finland’s money goes to Hamas.” Edward Wongcontributed reporting.

ByIsabel Kershner Israel on Sunday stepped up efforts to prevent Israeli protesters from blocking the flow of aid into Gaza, two days after the United Nations’ highest court said it must allow more supplies to get into the enclave. The Israeli military has declared the area around a border crossing into Gaza a closed military zone in a bid to stop the protests that have for several days impeded the movement of aid through the only open crossing between Israel and Gaza. The decision was made Saturday night but announced publicly only Sunday afternoon. Dozens of protesters had been blocking the Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Israel since Wednesday, arguing that no humanitarian assistance should pass through into Gaza until Hamas releases all of the captives it is holding there. The International Court of Justice in The Hague, making an interim ruling in a case in which Israel is being accused of genocide in Gaza, on Friday orderedthe delivery of more humanitarian aid to Palestiniansand called for the release of hostages being held by armed groups in the enclave. Before the military announced the closed zone, many protesters had walked through open fields to bypass police roadblocks, thwarting efforts by the Israeli authorities to stop them, according to footage posted online by a group behind the demonstrations. A few trucks managed to enter Gaza before the protesters arrived at the crossing, according to Israeli news media reports. The military order is meant to bar access to all unauthorized people and will remain in force through next Saturday. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Black Pastors Pressure Biden to Call for a Cease-Fire in Gaza,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/28/us/politics/black-pastors-biden-gaza-israel.html,2024-01-28T10:01:04+0000,Black congregants’ dismay at President Biden’s posture on the war could imperil his re-election bid.,"As the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth month, a coalition of Black faith leaders is pressuring the Biden administration to push for a cease-fire — a campaign spurred in part by their parishioners, who are increasingly distressed by the suffering of Palestinians and critical of the president’s response to it."," Black congregants’ dismay at President Biden’s posture on the war could imperil his re-election bid. Black congregants’ dismay at President Biden’s posture on the war could imperil his re-election bid. Credit... Supported by ByMaya King Reporting from Atlanta and Columbia, S.C. As the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth month, a coalition of Black faith leaders is pressuring the Biden administration to push for a cease-fire — a campaign spurred in part by their parishioners, who are increasingly distressed by the suffering of Palestinians and critical of the president’s response to it. More than 1,000 Black pastors representing hundreds of thousands of congregants nationwide have issued the demand. In sit-down meetings with White House officials, and through open letters and advertisements, ministers have made a moral case for President Biden and his administration to press Israel to stop its offensive operations in Gaza, which have killed thousands of civilians. They are also calling for the release of hostages held by Hamas and an end to Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. The effort at persuasion also carries a political warning, detailed in interviews with a dozen Black faith leaders and their allies. Many of their parishioners, these pastors said, are so dismayed by the president’s posture toward the war that their support for his re-election bid could be imperiled. “Black faith leaders are extremely disappointed in the Biden administration on this issue,” said the Rev. Timothy McDonald, the senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta, which boasts more than 1,500 members. He was one of the first pastors of more than 200 Black clergy members in Georgia, a key swing state, to sign an open letter calling for a cease-fire. “We are afraid,” Mr. McDonald said. “And we’ve talked about it — it’s going to be very hard to persuade our people to go back to the polls and vote for Biden.” Any cracks in the ordinarily rock-solid foundation of Black support for Mr. Biden, and for Democrats nationally, could be of enormous significance in November.

"Where Is Hamas Getting Its Weapons?

ByMaria Abi-HabibandSheera Frenkel Maria Abi-Habib reported from London, and Sheera Frenkel from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Israeli military and intelligence officials have concluded that a significant number of weapons used by Hamas in the Oct. 7 attacks and in the war in Gaza came from an unlikely source: the Israeli military itself. For years, analysts have pointed to underground smuggling routes to explain how Hamas stayed so heavily armed despite an Israeli military blockade of the Gaza Strip. But recent intelligence has shown the extent to which Hamas has been able to build many of its rockets and anti-tank weaponry out of the thousands of munitions that failed to detonate when Israel lobbed them into Gaza, according to weapons experts and Israeli and Western intelligence officials. Hamas is also arming its fighters with weapons stolen from Israeli military bases. Intelligence gathered during months of fighting revealed that, just as the Israeli authorities misjudged Hamas’s intentions before Oct. 7, they also underestimated its ability to obtain arms. What is clear now is that the very weapons that Israeli forces have used to enforce a blockade of Gaza over the past 17 years are now being used against them. Israeli and American military explosives have enabled Hamas to shower Israel with rockets and, for the first time, invade Israeli towns from Gaza. “Unexploded ordnance is a main source of explosives for Hamas,” said Michael Cardash, the former deputy head of the Israeli National Police Bomb Disposal Division and an Israeli police consultant. “They are cutting open bombs from Israel, artillery bombs from Israel, and a lot of them are being used, of course, and repurposed for their explosives and rockets.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The countries joined the United States, which said on Friday it would withhold funding for the group, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, after a dozen of its employees were accused by Israel of participating in the Oct. 7 attacks. The United Nations has not made public the details of the accusations against the UNRWA employees, who have been fired, but a senior U.N. official briefed on the accusations called them “extremely serious and horrific.” The Israeli military said in a statement Saturday that its intelligence services had compiled a case “incriminating several UNRWA employees for their alleged involvement in the massacre, along with evidence pointing to the use of UNRWA facilities for terrorist purposes.” It did not elaborate on what that involvement entailed. In announcing the pause in funding, the United States, the agency’s largest donor, said it was reviewing the allegations “and the steps the United Nations is taking to address them.” The governments of Australia, Canada, Finland and Iceland also said they were suspending funding for the agency.

Negotiators Close In on Hostage Deal That Would Halt Fighting in Gaza for Weeks,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/27/us/politics/hostage-deal-cease-fire-hamas-gaza.html,2024-01-27T23:25:12+0000,A written draft agreement calls for the phased release of captives held by Hamas in exchange for a cessation in Israel’s military offensive for about two months.,"American-led negotiators are edging closer to an agreement in which Israel would suspend its war in Gaza for about two months in exchange for the release of more than 100 hostages still held by Hamas, a deal that could be sealed in the next two weeks and would transform the conflict consuming the region.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by A written draft agreement calls for the phased release of captives held by Hamas in exchange for a cessation in Israel’s military offensive for about two months. ByPeter Baker Reporting from Washington American-led negotiators are edging closer to an agreement in which Israel would suspend its war in Gaza for about two months in exchange for the release of more than 100 hostages still held by Hamas, a deal that could be sealed in the next two weeks and would transform the conflict consuming the region. Negotiators have developed a written draft agreement merging proposals offered by Israel and Hamas in the last 10 days into a basic framework that will be the subject of talks in Paris on Sunday. While there are still important disagreements to be worked out, negotiators are cautiously optimistic that a final accord is within reach, according to U.S. officials who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive talks. President Biden spoke by phone separately Friday with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar, who have served as intermediaries with Hamas, to narrow the remaining differences. He is also sending his C.I.A. director,William J. Burns, to Paris for Sunday’s talks with Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials. If Mr. Burns makes enough progress, Mr. Biden may then send his Middle East coordinator,Brett McGurk, who just returned to Washington, back to the region to help finalize the agreement. “Both leaders affirmed that a hostage deal is central to establishing a prolonged humanitarian pause in the fighting and ensure additional lifesaving humanitarian assistance reaches civilians in need throughout Gaza,” the White House said in a statement Friday night summarizing the president’s conversation with Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahmanal-Thani, Qatar’s prime minister. “They underscored the urgency of the situation and welcomed the close cooperation among their teams to advance recent discussions.” In a statement in Israel on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed his commitment to securing the release of those hostages who were not freed as part of a more limited agreement in November. “As of today, we have returned 110 of our hostages and we are committed to returning all of them home,” he said. “We are dealing with this and we are doing so around the clock, including now.” The hostages have been in captivity since Oct. 7, when Hamas gunmen stormed into Israel and killed an estimated 1,200 people and seized about 240 more in the worst terrorist attack in the country’s history. Israel’s military retaliation since then has killed more than 25,000 people, most of them women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry. It is not clear how many of those killed in Gaza were Hamas combatants. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

ByPatrick KingsleyandEdward Wong To understand the secret negotiations, New York Times reporters spoke to more than a dozen diplomats and officials from seven nations and the Palestinian Authority. Top officials from at least 10 different administrations are trying to forge ahead-spinning set of dealsto end the Gaza war and answer the divisive question of how the territory will be governed after the fighting stops. The narrowest set of major discussions is focused on reaching a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. This would involve the exchange of more than 100 Israeli hostages held by Hamas for a cease-fire and thousands of Palestinians detained in Israeli jails. A second track centers on reshaping the Palestinian Authority, the semiautonomous body that administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. American and Arab officials are discussing overhauling the leadership of the authority and having it take control of Gaza after the war ends, assuming power from Israel and Hamas. In a third track, American and Saudi officials are pushing Israel to agree to conditions for the creation of a Palestinian state in exchange for Saudi Arabia forging formal ties with Israel for the first time ever. The demands and outcomes discussed in all three processes are linked, and the talks are mostly seen as long shots. The war began with the Hamas terrorist attack of Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people, Israeli officials said. The Israeli counterattack has left more than 25,000 Palestinians dead in Gaza, say Health Ministry officials there. President Biden has given Israel full support for the war.

ByAdam Rasgon,Aaron BoxermanandThomas Fuller Adam Rasgon and Aaron Boxerman reported from Jerusalem, and Thomas Fuller from San Francisco. Scores of displaced Palestinians fled the grounds of a hospital in southern Gaza as fighting raged on Wednesday in and around the city of Khan Younis, where the Israeli military says it is trying to crush a Hamas stronghold. Videos verified by The New York Times show families fleeing the hospital, Nasser Medical Center in Khan Younis, carrying duffel bags, backpacks and blankets as the sound of explosions reverberated. The Israeli military said this week that they had detected mortar fire aimed at its forces from the hospital complex, the largest in the southern Gaza Strip. The fighting around the hospital underlines the dangers for civilians in southern Gaza as the Israeli military converges on Khan Younis. About 7,000 people were believed to have been sheltering on the hospital’s grounds, the United Nations’ humanitarian office said on Wednesday, adding that an “intensification of hostilities” in the area also made it harder for patients and health workers to get access to the hospital. Many displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza have relocated several times since the war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, an experience that has reinforced the feeling thatnowhere is safe in the enclave. The Gazan health authorities say that more than 24,000 people, including women and children, have been killed in the enclave since then. Hamas’s Khan Younis brigade is among the armed group’s last major forces, as their fighters in northern Gaza have been largely subdued, according to Israeli military officials. Israeli troops, led by the military’s 98th division, have been advancing into the Palestinian city since December, after the collapse of a brief cease-fire with Hamas.

ByEdward Wong Reporting from Cairo Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, met on Thursday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt in Cairo to discuss the dire situation of Palestinian civilians in the Israel-Hamas war and what will happen in Gaza when the conflict ends. Mr. Blinken also planned to speak with Mr. el-Sisi about how to prevent the intensifying conflict in the region from escalating further, U.S. officials said. Militias supported by Iran have been attacking American and Israeli forces, and the most urgent challenge to the United States is posed by the Houthis of Yemen. U.S. officials say the Houthis have beenusing drones, rockets and missilesprovided by Iran to fire at commercial ships and U.S. warships in the Red Sea, prompting Mr. Blinken to declare on Wednesday that there would be “consequences.” On Thursday, U.S.-led strikeshit multiple targets in Yemenlinked to the Houthis, an Iran-backed militant group. Mr. Blinken met Mr. el-Sisi at the presidential palace after landing in a U.S. military C-17 plane from Tel Aviv. Mr. el-Sisi has insisted since the start of the war that Israel not permanently displace Palestinians. On Wednesday, he traveled to Aqaba, Jordan, to take part in a summit on the war called by King Abdullah II. Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian Authority, which administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, also attended the summit, just hours after meeting with Mr. Blinken in Ramallah. The Arab leaders issued a statement that rejected “any attempts to reoccupy parts of Gaza” by Israel, and they stressed that displaced Palestinians must be able to return home. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel tried last October to get Mr. Blinken to ask Mr. el-Sisi to take Palestinian refugees, since Egypt shares a border with Gaza. Since then, the Israeli military has killed more than 23,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Gazan health ministry. And it has destroyed many of the buildings in the tiny coastal strip and issued evacuation orders, forcing most of the two million people there to seek temporary shelter within Gaza. Some Israeli officials have suggested that Palestinians should not be allowed to live near Gaza’s border with Israel, in order to create a security buffer zone that could help prevent another attack like the one on Oct. 7, when Israeli authorities say Hamas killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel. Last week, two far-right cabinet officials proposed a mass resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza. All neighboring countries have refused to allow Israel to push refugees into their territories. After a full day of meetings with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Mr. Blinken said at a news conference that he had insisted to Mr. Netanyahu that Palestinian civilians be allowed to return home as soon as conditions allowed. And he said it was U.S. policy to ensure that Palestinians are not resettled outside Gaza. He told reporters that Mr. Netanyahu had reassured him it was not the Israeli government’s policy to move Palestinians out.

"U.N. Court Orders Israel to Prevent Genocide, but Does Not Demand Stop to War",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/world/middleeast/icj-israel-gaza-genocide.html,2024-01-27T00:00:13+0000,"The top United Nations court in The Hague did not rule on whether Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, the accusation that South Africa brought before the court.","The United Nations’ highest court said on Friday that Israel must take action to prevent acts of genocide by its forces in the Gaza Strip, adding to the international pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reduce death and destruction in the battered Palestinian enclave.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by The top United Nations court in The Hague did not rule on whether Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, the accusation that South Africa brought before the court. transcript “The State of Israel shall take all measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide in relation to members of the Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip.” “Cease-fire now. Cease-fire now.” “The cries and suffering of our people in Gaza have been heard in the great hall of justice.” “The fact of delivering humanitarian aid. The fact of taking measures that reduce the levels of harm against persons who have no role in what Israel is combating, for me, requires a cease-fire.” “Bring them home.” “Israel has an inherent right to defend itself. The vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish state.” ByPatrick Kingsley,Raja Abdulrahim,Aaron BoxermanandMichael Levenson The United Nations’ highest court said on Friday that Israel must take action to prevent acts of genocide by its forces in the Gaza Strip, adding to the international pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reduce death and destruction in the battered Palestinian enclave. But the court did not rule on whether Israel was committing genocide, and it did not call on Israel to stop its military campaign to crush Hamas, as South Africa, which brought the case, had requested. Whilethe rulinghad elements that each side could embrace, the court allowed the case charging Israel with genocide to proceed, which will likely keep the country under international scrutiny for years to come. “The court is acutely aware of the extent of the human tragedy that is unfolding in the region, and is deeply concerned about the continuing loss of life and human suffering,” Joan E. Donoghue, the president of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, said as she announced the interim ruling. The decision also ordered the delivery of more humanitarian aid to Palestinians, and called for the release of hostages held by armed groups in Gaza. The South Africans who argued the case this month have equated the oppression they faced under apartheid with the plight of Palestinians. The genocide accusation is acutely sensitive for Israel, which was founded in 1948 in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Many Israelis argue that it is Hamas that should face charges of genocideafter its attack on Oct. 7, when about 1,200 people were killed in Israel and about 240 were taken captive, according to Israeli officials.

The Meaning of the First I.C.J.

ByAmanda Taub Reporting from London Today the United Nations’ highest court, the International Court of Justice, issued its first, preliminarydecisionin thegenocide caseSouth Africa brought against Israel. South Africa won its application for “provisional measures,” roughly equivalent to a temporary injunction, ordering Israel to take proactive steps to ensure genocide doesn’t occur in the future, while the broader case is pending. But the court declined to order the immediate cease-fire that South Africa requested. Instead, it ordered Israel to prevent its forces from committing or inciting genocidal acts, and to enable humanitarian assistance and basic services in Gaza. It also said it was “gravely concerned” about the fate of the remaining hostages abducted by Hamas and called for their “immediate and unconditional release.” Israeli officials, who have strongly denied the genocide accusation,denounced the provisional measuresorder, but expressed relief that the court had not ordered a cease-fire. So what does the decision mean? And what might happen next? “People tend to have a really bifurcated view of what this court is and can do,” said Kate Cronin-Furman, a professor at University College London who studies accountability for mass atrocities. “Either they think the U.N. will be coming in with black helicopters to enforce orders, or they think the judgments of the court are just empty words with no impact.” The reality, experts say, is somewhere in between. The court has no direct enforcement powers, helicopter based or otherwise. But a decision like this can still have an impact by shifting the political calculations of the countries involved — and their allies. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByFarnaz Fassihi,Edward Wong,Russell GoldmanandRonen Bergman Reporting from the United Nations, Washington and Tel Aviv The United Nations on Friday fired 12 of its employees in Gaza and began an investigation into them after accusations by Israel that they had helped plan and had participated in the Oct. 7 terrorist assault that left about 1,200 Israelis dead and more than 240 others captured. The workers, all men employed by the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians, known by the acronym UNRWA, are subject to a criminal investigation, two U.N. officials said. “UNRWA reiterates its condemnation in the strongest possible terms of the abhorrent attacks,” said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the agency. “Any UNRWA employee who was involved in acts of terror will be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution.” In addition, a senior U.N. official, briefed on the accusations, called the allegations “extremely serious and horrific.” UNRWA has long denied Israel’s claims that it fuels anti-Israeli incitement in Gaza. But it took a sharply different approach to the more serious accusations on Friday, just days after Israel presented them to the agency. The accusations quickly led the United States to temporarily halt funding to the organization. UNRWA, which provides social services in the Gaza Strip, has been the principal agency overseeing the distribution of aid to Gazans amid a dire humanitarian crisis in the territory that has worsened through months of war since the Oct. 7 attack.

Plans for Gaza’s ‘Day After’ Seem Ever Distant,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/europe/gaza-peace-plans-day-after.html,2024-01-25T17:18:38+0000,"The very idea that there will be a clear line between war and peace is misleading, given the politics, security needs and anxieties of all sides.","As the war in Gaza grinds on, there is increasing talk of some “day after” formula for the broken territory.

BySteven Erlanger Steven Erlanger reported from Jerusalem. As the war in Gaza grinds on, there is increasing talk of some “day after” formula for the broken territory. But that notion is an ephemeral one — there is not going to be a bright line between war and peace in Gaza, even if some sort of negotiated settlement is reached. Israel has made it clear that it will not subcontract security along its southern border to anyone else, and Israeli military officials say their forces will come in and out of Gaza based on intelligence for a very long time to come, even after troops finally withdraw. “The whole conceit of ‘the day after’ has to be retired,” said Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. official at the Carnegie Endowment. “It’s misleading and dangerous,” he said, because there will be no clear dividing line “between the end of Israeli military operations and a relative stability that allows people to focus on reconstruction.” There are a variety of sketchy ideas — “plans” would be too specific a word — for what happens in the aftermath of hostilities. But there is a growing understanding that any sustainable settlement would require a regional deal involving countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Qatar. Inevitably such a deal would have to be led by the United States, Israel’s most trusted ally. Most officials and analysts assume it would require new governments both in Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which partially governs the West Bank but is considered stale and corrupt, an indication of the long road ahead.

What to Know About the U.N. Court’s Initial Ruling in the Genocide Case Against Israel,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/middleeast/icj-israel-genocide-ruling.html,2024-01-25T18:50:21+0000,"The International Court of Justice ruled that Israel must take steps to prevent genocide in Gaza, but stopped short of demanding a stop to its military offensive.",The International Court of Justice issued an interim ruling on Friday in a wider case about whether Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in the enclave.,"Israel-HamasWar Advertisement The International Court of Justice ruled that Israel must take steps to prevent genocide in Gaza, but stopped short of demanding a stop to its military offensive. ByMatthew Mpoke BiggandGaya Gupta The International Court of Justice issued an interim ruling on Friday in a wider case about whether Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in the enclave. Decisions by the court, the United Nations’ top judicial body, are binding, but the court has few means of enforcement. Still, the ruling added to international pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government over the war. Israel has strongly rejected the genocide charge. Here’s what to know about the ruling. The interim ruling came in response to South Africa’s request for “provisional measures” to stop Israel’s military campaign in Gaza while the court considered the broader genocide charge. On Friday, the court ruled that Israel must take actions to prevent acts by its forces in Gaza that are banned under the 1948 Genocide Convention, including indiscriminate killing of Palestinians and “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.” The judges also ordered Israel to prevent and punish public statements that constitute incitements to genocide and to ensure basic services and humanitarian aid to get into Gaza. They also directed Israel to preserve evidence related to allegations of genocide. Finally, the judges ordered Israel to report back to the court within a month to show how it is complying with the order. Still, the court stopped short of calling for Israel to suspend its military campaign, in line withwhat many legal experts had predicted. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Israel’s legal team has challenged the charge by providing the court with secret orders made by Israel’s civilian and military leaders. ByPatrick Kingsley To report this article, Patrick Kingsley reviewed Israel and South Africa’s submissions to the International Court of Justice and spoke to legal experts. Israel has declassified more than 30 secret orders made by government and military leaders, which it says rebut thechargethat it committed genocide in Gaza, and instead show Israeli efforts to diminish deaths among Palestinian civilians. The release of the documents, copies of which were reviewed by The New York Times, follows a petition to the International Court of Justice by South Africa, which has accused Israel of genocide. Much of South Africa’s case hinges on inflammatory public statements made by Israeli leaders that it says are proof of intent to commit genocide. Part of Israel’s defense is to prove that whatever politicians may have said in public was overruled by executive decisions and official orders from Israel’s war cabinet and its military’s high command. The court, the U.N.’s highest judicial body, began hearing arguments in the case this month, and is expected to provide an initial response to South Africa’s petition — in which it could call for a provisional cease-fire — as soon as Friday. Since October, Israel has pounded Gaza in a campaign that has killed more than 25,000 Gazans, or roughly one in 100 residents of the territory, according to Gazan health officials; displaced nearly two million people; and damaged the majority of the buildings, according to the U.N. The campaign is a response to a Hamas-led assault that led to the deaths and abductions of roughly 1,400 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials.

ByAaron Boxerman,Patrick KingsleyandAdam Rasgon reporting from Jerusalem The director of the C.I.A. is set to make a renewed push for negotiations over the release of hostages held in Gaza and an extended cease-fire, according to U.S. officials, who said he would meet with senior Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials in Europe. The officials hope to close a wide gap between Israel and Hamas, especially on two issues: the length of any pause in fighting and the fate of Hamas leaders in Gaza, according to officials briefed on the talks. Here is a look at where the talks stand. A weeklong truce in November allowed the release of more than 100 of the hostages abducted in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel; 240 Palestinian prisoners were released as part of that deal. Since then, both sides have staked out seemingly intractable positions for another such agreement. The talks have advanced in fits and starts, with the leader of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency meeting withQatari officialsin both Qatar and Europe. Many of Hamas’s political leaders are based in Qatar. Egypt, which borders the Gaza Strip, has also played a key role. William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, is going to meet with senior Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials, according to U.S. officials. They said Israel’s apparent willingness to agree to a longer cessation of hostilities as part of any further hostage releases has created a new opening for negotiations. Any new deal would likely include phased releases of hostages, though the White House is hoping that a bigger deal, leading to the release of the remaining hostages, might be possible.

ByHiba Yazbek,Ameera HaroudaandMichael Levenson Israeli forces pushed deeper into southern Gaza’s largest city on Wednesday, surrounding two major hospitals where thousands of people were seeking safety as a strike on a United Nations shelter killed at least nine people, according to U.N. officials and local health officials. The Israeli military said it had “currently ruled out” that its aerial or artillery fire had been responsible for the strike on the shelter in Khan Younis, where the U.N. was housing about 800 people. In addition to the nine dead, 75 other people were injured,according to Thomas White, who helps oversee U.N. aid operations in Gaza. U.N. officials did not directly blame Israel, but said the shelter, in a vocational training center, had been hit by two tank rounds. Israel is the only combatant in Gaza with tanks. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. Palestinian aid agency, said that the shelter was“clearly marked” as a U.N. facility and that its coordinates had been shared with the Israeli authorities. “Once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,”Mr. Lazzarini wroteon social media. At a news conference in Washington, Vedant Patel, a State Department spokesman, called the strike “incredibly concerning” and added: “Civilians must be protected, and the protected nature of U.N. facilities must be respected.” He declined to say whether U.S. officials had spoken to the Israelis about the shelter strike.

Mr. Cameron made the case during a private meeting with Mr. Netanyahu in Jerusalem. In a statement Thursday morning, he said he had told Mr. Netanyahu that more crossings into Gaza needed to be opened to allow more trucks to enter. “The scale of suffering in Gaza is unimaginable,” Mr. Cameron said. “We need an immediate humanitarian pause to get aid in and hostages out, followed by a sustainable cease-fire, without a return to hostilities.” After the meeting in Jerusalem, Mr. Cameron traveled to the West Bank to meet the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. On Thursday he was in Qatar, where he spoke with the prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and said the two countries were jointly sending tents to Gaza to shelter displaced people. The mounting civilian death toll in Gaza has become an acute source of concern in London. But Mr. Cameron’s pleas to the Israelis, like those of President Biden and his aides, have not borne much fruit, and on Wednesday, he found a defiant Israeli leader, who along with much of the country was mourning the deaths of 24 Israel Defense Force soldiers in the Gazan city of Khan Younis. “We will continue to fight determinedly to vanquish the brutal enemy we face,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a speech on Wednesday marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Israeli Knesset. “We will continue to safeguard our national revival.” Mr. Cameron and Mr. Netanyahu have a historyof diplomatic relations going back more than a decade. When Mr. Cameron was prime minister, the Israeli leader referred to him as a “true friend of Israel,” though the two diverged in the pastover GazaandIsrael’s settlement policy.

ByZachary Small The first American retrospective of Samia Halaby, regarded as one of the most important living Palestinian artists, was abruptly canceled by officials at Indiana University in recent weeks. Dozens of her vibrant and abstract paintings were already at the school when Halaby, 87, said she received a call from the director of the university’sEskenazi Museum of Art. The director informed her that employees had shared concern abouther social media posts on the Israel-Gaza war, where she had expressed support for Palestinian causes and outrage at the violence in the Middle East, comparing the Israeli bombardment to a genocide. Halaby later received a two-sentence note from the museum director, David Brenneman, officially canceling the show in Bloomington, Ind., without a clear explanation. “I write to formally notify you that the Eskenazi Museum of Art will not host its planned exhibition of your work,” Brenneman wrote in the Dec. 20 letter, which was reviewed by The New York Times. A few months earlier, Brenneman had applauded the artist’s “dynamic and innovative approach to art-making” in promotional materials, where he said the exhibition would demonstrate how universities “value artistic experimentation.” The show’s cancellation is the latest example of the heavy scrutiny that artists and academics have faced since the war began in October.Magazine editors have been fired,artists have seen their work censoredand university presidentshave resignedunder pressure.

BySharon Otterman Three weeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, the Department of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Barnard College in New York posted a statement on itsdepartmental websitein support of the Palestinian people. Below the statement, the professors posted links to academic work supporting their view that the struggle of Palestinians against “settler colonial war, occupation and apartheid” was also a feminist issue. Two days later, they found that section of the webpage had been removed, without warning, by Barnard administrators. What happened next has sparked a crisis over academic freedom and free expression at Barnard at a time when the Israel-Hamas conflict has led to tense protests on American college campuses and heated discussions about what constitutes acceptable speech. Asked to explain why the page was removed, college administrators told the department that the statement and links were “impermissible political speech,”a statement from the department said. The Barnard administration then, in late October and November, rewrote its policies on political activity, website governance and campus events, giving itself wide latitude to decide what was and was not permissible political speech on campus, as well as final say over everything posted on Barnard’s website. The moves caught the attention of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which wrotea letterto Barnard’s new president, Laura Rosenbury, in December, warning that the website and political speech policies violated fundamental free speech principles and were “incompatible with a sound understanding of academic freedom.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByVivian Nereim Soon after Yemen’s Houthi militia hijacked a commercial ship in the Red Sea, taking it and its 25-member crew hostage, the armed group used the vessel to record amusic video. In the slick production, called “Axis of Jihad,” a drone camera pans over the hulking ship. Then a famous Houthi poet appears on the deck — accompanied by what appears to be a cardboard cutout of Qassim Suleimani, theIranian commanderassassinated in 2020 — and begins to sing. “Death to America and hostile Zion,” the poet, Issa al-Laith, calls out, backed by a relentless beat. “By God, we shall not be defeated!” The Houthis — an Iran-backed militia that controls northwestern Yemen — have long been skilled producers of propaganda, crafting poetry, television shows and catchy music videos to spread their messages. But they have never had as large an audience as they do now, as the war in the Gaza Strip propels them to the center of a global battle of accounts and attracts new admirers around the world. Over the past few months, the Houthis have vaulted to worldwide prominence by shooting missiles toward Israel and attacking ships in the Red Sea, causing limited damage but disrupting theflow of global trade. The United States and its allies have targeted the group withrepeated airstrikesthis month, further raising its profile, but the assaults on shipping have continued.

To Israelis, the charge is a perversion of history. But for Palestinians it creates a fleeting sense of justice. ByPatrick Kingsley Reporting from Jerusalem Whatever its outcome, the accusation of genocideleveled this week against Israel at the world’s top courtis an epochal intervention imbued with profound symbolism for both Israelis and Palestinians. In the granular sense, thecase at the International Court of Justiceis a chance to assess three months of devastation in Gaza. Israel stands accused of committing genocide against the Palestinian people in a military campaign that haskilled roughly 1 in 100 Gazansand displaced nearly two million others. But the case, brought by South Africa to the court in The Hague, has also taken on a broader resonance: Among both Israelis and Palestinians, it is perceived as a proxy for a far older battle over the legitimacy of their respective national causes. To many Israelis, the case is the culmination of a decades-long effort to turn Israel into a pariah by holding the country — which was itself founded in the aftermath of a genocide of Jews — to a far higher level of scrutiny than other nations. They see their invasion of the Gaza Strip as a war of defense against an enemy, Hamas, that inflicted its own genocidalattack on Israel on Oct. 7, prompting the Israeli military to pursue Hamas into Gaza just as any other army would have done.

ByRaja Abdulrahim Cold, almost naked and surrounded by Israeli soldiers with M16 assault rifles, Ayman Lubbad knelt among dozens of Palestinian men and boys who had just beenforcedfrom their homes in northern Gaza. It was early December andphotographsandvideos taken atthe time showed him and other detainees in the street, wearing only underwear and lined up in rows, surrounded by Israeli forces. In one video, a soldier yelled at them over a megaphone: “We’re occupying all of Gaza. Is that what you wanted? You want Hamas with you? Don’t tell me you’re not Hamas.” The detainees, some barefoot with their hands on their heads, shouted objections. “I’m a day laborer,” one man shouted. “Shut up,” the soldier yelled back. Palestinian detainees from Gaza have been stripped, beaten, interrogated and held incommunicado over the past three months, according to accounts by nearly a dozen of the detainees or their relatives interviewed by The New York Times. Organizations representing Palestinian prisoners and detainees gave similar accounts inareport, accusing Israel of both indiscriminate detention of civilians and demeaning treatment of detainees. Israeli forces who invaded Gaza after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack have detained men, women and children by the thousands. Some were ordered out of their houses and seized while others were taken as they fled their neighborhoods on foot with their families, trying to reach safer areas after the Israeli authorities ordered them to leave.

ByMatthew Mpoke BiggandAmeera Harouda Israel’s military said on Tuesday that it had encircled the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, part of a push that has resulted in intense fighting and bombardments in an area packed with civilians who have fled their homes in other parts of the territory. The Israeli military described the area as a “significant stronghold” of Hamas’s Khan Younis brigade and said that it had killed dozens of Hamas fighters over the previous 24 hours. The military’s claims could not be independently verified. Israeli forces “targeted terrorist cells carrying R.P.G.s near the troops, those launching anti-tank missiles, and terror operatives who had rigged compounds with explosives,” the military said in a statement, referring to rocket-propelled grenade launchers. “Ready-to-launch rockets, military compounds, shafts, and numerous weapons were located during the activity,” the military added. The fighting has involvedheavy exchanges of gunfireand a surge of Israeli tanks and troops into areas around the city’s hospitals. Displaced civilians in the area say they have no safe place to go. Eman Jawad, who is sheltering in an industrial zone in Khan Younis, said that Israeli forces surrounded her shelter on Sunday night and heavy clashes broke out with Hamas fighters. She said the fighting was so close that several tents housing displaced people went up in flames. “We are trapped,” Ms. Jawad said in a voice message on Monday. “There are snipers on the streets and we are not allowed to leave the industrial zone.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByGaya Gupta Columbia University and the Police Department are investigating reports that pro-Palestinian student demonstrators were sprayed with a foul-smelling chemical during a protest last week, leading the university on Monday to bar the people accused of spraying it from campus. In a statement that was emailed to all Columbia students and faculty members on Monday night, Dennis A. Mitchell, the university’s interim provost, said that the individuals had been barred while the Police Department investigated “what appears to have been serious crimes, possibly hate crimes.” He called the events at the protest, on the steps of Low Library, “deeply troubling” and added that the university condemned “in the strongest possible terms any threats or acts of violence” directed toward its community members. Some students required medical treatment, the statement said. A spokesman for the Police Department said that there had been no arrests and that an investigation was continuing. The Columbia statement did not say how many people had been barred from campus or whether they were students. It did not specify what substance had been sprayed on the protesters or what had led to the incident. Since the Israel-Hamas war began in October, pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel demonstrations have roiled Columbia and other American college campuses.

Israel-E.U.

ByMatina Stevis-Gridneff,Hiba Yazbek,Adam Rasgon,Monika PronczukandMichael Levenson European foreign ministers pressed their Israeli counterpart on Monday to agree to the creation of a Palestinian state, in a meeting that left European diplomats bewildered about postwar Israeli plans for the Gaza Strip and reinforced the deep disconnect between Israel and much of the world. The two sides appeared to be having two different conversations. Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union’s top diplomat, said after the meeting in Brussels that European nations were resolute that “sustainable, lasting peace” must include Palestinian statehood, an option that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has doubled down on opposing in recent days. Israel’s foreign minister, Yisrael Katz, presented to the Europeans a plan involving an artificial island off Gaza’s coast — a plan that did not address the future governance of the territory, according to officials in the meeting. While the diplomats talked past each other, heavy fighting intensified in southern Gaza on Monday, with medical personnel reporting major exchanges of gunfire and a surge of Israeli tanks and troops into areas around hospitals. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society and the Gazan Health Ministry said many people had been killed or wounded on Monday in Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s largest city, without providing specific counts. Nahed Abu Taaema, the director of surgery at Nasser Hospital, the area’s largest hospital, told Al Jazeera in a televised interview that it had received 100 wounded people and 50 bodies. “Khan Younis is very dangerous now,” Nebal Farsakh, a spokeswoman for the Red Crescent, said in an interview. “The whole district of Khan Younis is essentially besieged.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByTroy Closson New York City will offer new curriculum materials on antisemitism and Islamophobia in its public schools and train principals and teachers on how to have difficult conversations about politically charged issues, officials said on Monday in response to criticism that the system has done too little to address the Israel-Hamas war. In higher education, colleges like Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania have faced a backlash over their responses to the war. A speech announcing the new effort by the city’s schools chancellor, David C. Banks, illustrated how difficult it has been for K-12 leaders to stay out of the fray. “The way through this moment is not to malign our students or to impose our own ideologies on them — or to bury our heads in the sand,” Mr. Banks said on Monday. “We must educate our students, and sometimes our staff.” He added: “We cannot and will not have schools where students feel like they can do whatever they want without accountability for their actions.” The chancellor’s message was among the most direct acknowledgments of continued fallout over the war from a major American public school district. It came two months after araucous demonstration at Hillcrest High School in Queens— where officials said a pro-Israel teacher was targeted — became a major flashpoint for some Jewish families, who argued the system had not done enough to quell bias in schools. Since October, local conflicts in New York and other districts have often erupted into animated controversies on the national stage. A number of parent leaders and educators who have vocally supported Palestinians have encountered online harassment. And this month, a Brooklyn grade schoolfaced outrageafter a resurfaced social media post showed a classroom map that did not include Israel but called the region Palestine.

U.S. Expands Attacks on Houthis With New Strikes in Yemen,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/houthi-yemen-strikes.html,2024-01-22T21:51:49+0000,The strikes against eight sites come as the Iran-backed militant group remains defiant and the region teeters on the edge of a wider war.,"The United States and Britain carried out large-scale military strikes on Monday against eight sites in Yemen controlled by Houthi militants, according to the two countries.

ByEric Schmitt Reporting from Washington The United States and Britain carried out large-scale military strikes on Monday against eight sites in Yemen controlled by Houthi militants, according to the two countries. The strikes signaled that the Biden administration intends to wage a sustained and, at least for now, open-ended campaign against the Iran-backed group that has disrupted traffic in vital international sea lanes. The strikes — the eighth in nearly two weeks — hit multiple targets at each site, and were bigger and broader than a recent series of more limited attacks against individual Houthi missiles that the Americans said popped up on short notice. Those missiles were hit before they could be fired at ships in the Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden. But the planned nighttime strikes on Monday, which hit radars, as well as drone and missile sites and underground weapons storage bunkers, were smaller thanthe first retaliatory salvos on Jan. 11. Those hit more than 60 targets in nearly 30 sites across Yemen in an expansion of the conflict in the Middle East that the Biden administration had sought to avoid. This middle ground reflects the administration’s attempt to chip away at the Houthis’ ability to menace merchant ships and military vessels but not hit so hard as to kill large numbers of Houthi fighters and commanders, and potentially unleash even more mayhem into a region already teetering on the edge of a wider war. “Let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: We will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued threat,” the American and British governments said in a statement. They were joined in the statement by the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and Bahrain which, as they did in the Jan. 11 strikes, also participated, providing logistics, intelligence and other support, according to U.S. officials.

Mr. Biden has argued that the creation of a Palestinian state is the only viable long-term resolution to a conflict that has dragged on for decades, repeating a position held by most American presidents and European leaders in recent history. While there was no indication that Mr. Netanyahu would ease his strenuous opposition, which is popular with his fragile right-wing political coalition, Mr. Biden had expressed optimism that they might yet find consensus. “There are a number of types of two-state solutions,” the president told reporters at the White House several hours after Friday’s call, their first in nearly a month amid tension over the war. “There’s a number of countries that are members of the U.N. that are still — don’t have their own militaries. Number of states that have limitations.” He added, “And so I think there’s ways in which this could work.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByVivian Yee,Matina Stevis-GridneffandAdam Rasgon American, British and European officials are pressuring Israel to let aid for Gaza transit through the Israeli port of Ashdod to help alleviate a metastasizing humanitarian crisis, according to six U.S. and European officials. Israel’s military responded to the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by invading and declaring a siege on Gaza, which was already undera yearslong blockade. It has since allowed limited amounts of aid into the enclave through two border points, one in Israel and the other in Egypt, but those deliveries have been bogged down by inspections and logistical snarls. Humanitarian workers sayvastly more aid is neededto meaningfully help Gaza’s 2.2 million residents amid dire shortages offood, water and supplies. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken pressed Israeli officials about allowing Gaza aid through the port of Ashdod when he was in Tel Aviv earlier this month, according to one U.S. official. That official and the others interviewed about the new aid proposal spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. Under the new proposed agreement, aid would be shipped from Cyprus — an Israeli ally — to Ashdod, three of the officials said. From Ashdod, it would then be transported to Kerem Shalom, the Israeli border crossing through which aid has been allowed into Gaza, a European official said. The ultimate goal, an American and a European official said, is to establish a workable alternative to delivering aid via Egypt in a way that satisfies Israel’s demand for security checks.

He dreamed of studying business administration to help his family’s stores. He enjoyed taking care of his younger siblings and was “very polite, very respectful, very intelligent,” according to his mosque’s president. Then, suddenly, a bullet to his head ended everything. A Palestinian-American teenagerwas killed by gunfire in the occupied West Bank on Friday.The U.S. State Department confirmed the killing without naming the victim, but the teenager’s family identified him as Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, 17. The details of Tawfic’s death were unclear, but Tawfic’s family said he was hit after an off-duty Israeli soldier and Israeli settlers targeted the vehicle he was driving. The Israeli police has said that the killing involved an off-duty officer and an Israeli civilian, and that they were investigating the incident. Tawfic was born to Palestinian parents and was raised in the suburbs of New Orleans. His grandfather had come to America “looking for the American dream,” said Sherean Murad, the assistant principal at the Muslim Academy in Gretna, who taught Tawfic civics when he was in the 11th grade. Tawfic and his family had moved to the West Bank temporarily in May to connect with relatives — he hoped to improve his Arabic while he was there and planned to return to the United States for college.

ByCallie Holtermann On and off social media, watermelons are being used as a symbol to communicate solidarity with Palestinians in thedeadly war between Israel and Hamas. The fruit is painted on semicircles of cardboard at protests in support of Palestinians. The watermelon emoji appears next to the Palestinian flag in display names on TikTok and X, and thousands of Instagram users have liked anillustrationof a watermelon wedge whose seeds spell “ceasefire now.” The fruit isgrown in Gaza and the West Bank, and it is the same four colors — red, green, black and white — as the Palestinian flag. Palestinians have used it for decades as a symbol of identity and resistance, saidAmani Al-Khatahtbeh, 30, the founder of the digital publication Muslim Girl. “It’s taken on a much more widespread understanding” since the beginning of the war, Ms. Al-Khatahtbeh said. “There are people that have absolutely no connection whatsoever to Palestine and Israel, but they’re still using the emoji because of what it’s come to represent on social media.” The watermelon emoji is among several symbols used as shorthand in thefierce social media debatesabout the war, but it is more subtle than the Israeli and Palestinian flag emojis and the hashtags #IStandWithIsrael and #FreePalestine — and that’s often intentional. The watermelon symbol has roots in Israel’ssuppression of the Palestinian flag in Gaza and the West Bank, said Sascha Crasnow, a scholar of Palestinian art and a lecturer of Islamic arts in the Residential College at the University of Michigan.

ByEdward WongandVivian Nereim Edward Wong reported from Tel Aviv while traveling with the U.S. secretary of state, and Vivian Nereim reported from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, and a Saudi ambassador asserted on Tuesday the possibility of diplomatic recognition of Israel by Saudi Arabia if the Israeli government alleviates the suffering of residents of Gaza and puts Palestinians on a path toward statehood. During meetings in Tel Aviv, Mr. Blinken said Israel had “real opportunities” to strengthen ties with Arab nations, as he sought to find a political endgame to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and calm regional violence arising from the conflict, even as Israel says it isslowing downmajor combat operations in Gaza. Mr. Blinken’s comments were a reference to hisdeclarationon Monday night, after talks at a Saudi royal camp in the desert, that Saudi Arabia and other countries remained interested in eventually building normal diplomatic relations with Israel despite the destruction in Gaza. But Arab leaders insist Israel must end the Gaza war first and work toward a Palestinian state, Mr. Blinken said — a positionat odds with the Israeli government. A senior Saudi official made similar points on Tuesday, in the strongest signal since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and the start of the war that Riyadh remains open to talks of normalization, as long as Israel takes concrete steps that would benefit Palestinians. In aninterviewwith the BBC, Prince Khalid bin Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Britain, said that the kingdom’s talks with the United States about normalization had revolved around an endpoint that “included nothing less than an independent state of Palestine.” “While we still — going forward even after Oct. 7 — believe in normalization, it does not come at the cost of the Palestinian people,” Prince Khalid said.

ByAndrew KehandLiset Cruz Pro-Palestinian demonstrators on Monday blocked off entrances to the Holland Tunnel and the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges, disrupting rush-hour traffic in Manhattan as they protested Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip and called for a cease-fire. Protesters gathered at the Holland Tunnel around 9:30 a.m. and held aloft a Palestinian flag and banners that read “Lift the siege on Gaza” and “End the occupation.” Nearby, a group of demonstrators in fluorescent vests and masks linked arms and redirected cars away from the outbound ramp. Shortly thereafter, they were arrested, with some chanting “Free Palestine” as they sat on the ground with their hands tied. Similar scenes unfolded simultaneously at the three bridges, with traffic resuming, if slowly, by 11. A total of 325 protesters were arrested at all four sites, the police said. They had gathered at City Hall Park early Monday, before dispersing in smaller groups and traveling to the bridges and the tunnel. Mon Mohapatra, 30, one of the demonstrators at the Brooklyn Bridge, said the organizers on Monday represented various groups, including the Palestinian Youth Movement, Al-Awda: The Palestinian Right to Return Coalition, Democratic Socialists of America, Jewish Voice for Peace and others.

ByCassandra Vinograd Israel and Gaza. Yemen and the Red Sea. Lebanon, Syria, Iraq — and now Pakistan, too. At every flashpoint in a set of conflicts spanning 1,800 miles and involving a hodgepodge of unpredictable armed actors and interests, there’s been a common thread: Iran. Tehran has left its imprint with its behind-the-scenes backing of combatants in places like Lebanon and Yemen, and with this week’s direct missile strikeson targets in Iraq, Syria and Pakistan. The Iran connection stems partly from Iran’s decades-long efforts to deter threats and undermine foes by building up like-minded militias across the Middle East. In addition, Iran itself, like neighboring countries, faces armed separatist movements and terrorist groups in conflicts that readily spill over borders. But what does Pakistan have to do with Gaza? Here’s a look at how Iran ties together recent tensions. Ever since the 1979 revolution that made Iran a Shiite Muslim theocracy, it has been isolated and has seen itself as besieged.

It happened because of Michael Brown. It was August 2014, and in Ferguson, Mo., not far from her family’s well-off St. Louis neighborhood, protests were erupting afterBrown was killed by a police officer.At home, Borgwardt had often wondered who she would have been during the civil rights movement. Would she have really stood up for what was right? Now, as the demonstrations for racial justice and against police brutality dominated the news, her mother, a history professor and scholar of human rights law, told her, “This is a ‘Where were you in history?’ moment.” Borgwardt went to the protests wheeling a large cooler and handed out bottled water from the sidelines. “I was an 18-year-old white girl,” she said, “trying to be useful.” When the protesters marched, she tugged her ungainly cooler alongside them. In Ferguson, day after day, Borgwardt underwent “a deep reckoning with systemic racism for the first time,” she said. “I was having to realize that in these protests, on the streets, the police are not the good guys. That structures, like the police, that have served me my entire life are literally deadly and designed to oppress people who live in my city. It was nothing I had been exposed to before.” At the demonstrations, she was confronted by something else: the connection between the fight for racial justice in this country and the movement for Palestinian liberation. There were Palestinians at the rallies, their banners proclaiming, “Palestine Stands With Ferguson” and “Palestinian Lives Matter.” On Twitter, Borgwardt saw that Palestinians were tweeting support from 6,000 miles away, along with advice on how to cope with tear gas fired by the police. That summer, a deadly Palestinian attack and retaliation by the Israeli military in the West Bank led to weeks of warfare between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. “Suddenly,” Borgwardt recalled, “the parallels were so obvious to me. Black Americans facing a militarized police force and Palestinians in the West Bank facing a military charged with policing.” Borgwardt, who is Jewish, started to process language she heard at the protests in a new way. “I was socialized to hear phrases like ‘From the river to the sea’ and ‘Free Palestine’ as threatening, as meaning ‘Wipe the Jews off the map,’ instead of being about freedom and equality.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByDana Goldstein In the United States, some labor unions, city governments and town councils have weighed in on the Israel-Hamas war, issuing statements in support of a cease-fire — often over vociferous objections from some of their own members and constituents. On Wednesday night, the school board in Ann Arbor, Mich., became one of the first public school districts in the country to vote in favor of such a statement. Supporters of the resolution, including Palestinian American andJewish board members, said that the statement was an urgent moral necessity amid a humanitarian crisis. But the vote — 4 to 1, with two members abstaining — was divisive in Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan and sizable Arab and Jewish populations. At a meeting punctuated by cheers and jeering, some parents said that they did not see any role for the local school board in the conflict, despite their own wishes for the hostilities in Israel and Gaza to end. And they worried that singling out Israel for condemnation, in a world filled with wars and suffering, could fuel antisemitism in the district. One father said he planned to remove his children from the district’s schools. And several parents asked the board to refocus on other matters, such as the district’s search for a new superintendent and academic recovery following the pandemic.

ByMichael Crowley Reporting from Washington The Biden administration will designate Yemen’s Houthi militia as a terrorist organization, partly reimposing penalties it lifted nearly three years ago on the Iran-backed group whose attacks on regional shipping traffic have drawn a U.S. military response. Beginning in mid-February, the United States will consider the Houthis a “specially designated global terrorist” group, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a statement on Wednesday, blocking its access to the global financial system, among other penalties. But Biden officials stopped short of applying a second, more severe designation — that of “foreign terrorist organization” — which the Trump administration imposed on the Houthis in its final days. The State Department revoked both designations shortly after President Biden took office in early 2021. That further step would have made it far easier to prosecute criminally anyone who knowingly provides the Houthis with money, supplies, training or other “material support.” But aid groups are already warning that it could also impede humanitarian assistance to Yemen. The move comes as a response to, and an effort to halt, weeks of Houthi missile and drone attacks on maritime traffic off Yemen’s coast. Those attacks, which the group describes as a show of solidarity with Palestinians under Israeli bombardment in Gaza, have forced some major shipping companies to reroute their vessels, leading to delays and higher shipping costs worldwide. After issuing multiple warnings to the Houthis, Mr. Biden ordered dozens of strikes on their facilities in Yemen, althoughU.S. officials saythe group retains most of its ability to attack commerce in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. But the designation also reflects an effort to strike a balance, one that protects the flow of desperately needed humanitarian aid to the people of Yemen, who have endured famine, disease and displacement through more than a decade of civil war after the Houthis seized the country’s capital in September 2014. David Schenker, a former assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs in the Trump administration, said the Biden administration had chosen to “split the difference.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByAaron BoxermanandAdam Rasgon Reporting from Jerusalem Hamas fighters in the northern Gaza Strip fired at least 25 rockets toward a nearby Israeli city on Tuesday, renewing right-wing criticism in Israel of the government’s decision toscale back some military operationsin the war. Hamas said in a statement that it had targeted the Israeli city of Netivot, about six miles from the Gaza border. Most of the rockets were either intercepted by Israel’s missile defense system or fell into open areas, and there were no immediate reports of casualties. But the Israeli police said that at least one building had been damaged. The attack highlighted Hamas’s continuing ability tothreaten Israeli civilians with rocket firedespite more than 100 days of a devastating Israeli air and ground offensive aimed at destroying the group’s military capabilities. The rocket barrage also underlined the competing pressures Israeli leaders faced: the widespread popular demand to crush Hamas, the calls from right-wing politicians to be more aggressive in that campaign, the pleas by families of the hostages taken by Hamas to make concessions to secure their return and the outrage across the globe over the carnage and destruction in Gaza. Israeli military analysts say the army has significantly degraded the rocket-launching capabilities of Hamas and other, smaller militant groups in Gaza since the beginning of the war, but has not eliminated them — a process they said could take months, if not longer, to complete. “The continued firing of rockets tells us that we haven’t finished our mission,” Yaakov Amidror, a retired general who served as national security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, said in an interview. “There are still areas that we need to clean up.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But the debate highlighted Democratic resistance to providing unfettered aid. ByKaroun Demirjian Reporting from Washington When Hamas unleashed a bloody attack against Israel in October, there was a swift and strong bipartisan clamor of support in Congress for the United States to spare no expense in backing a robust military response by the Jewish state. More than 100 days later, that consensus on Capitol Hill shows signs of fraying, as left-wing Democrats alarmed by the rising human toll of the war in Gaza press to limit aid to Israel or impose strict conditions on it. The effort has divided Democrats and spurred an intensive lobbying countereffort by pro-Israel groups. It reached a peak on Tuesday, when the Senate voted on a resolution threatening to freeze all U.S. security aid to Israel unless the State Department produces a report within 30 days examining whether the country committed human rights violations in its conduct of the war. The Senate tabled the measure, forced to the floor by Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, by a vote of 72 to 11. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, joined Mr. Sanders and nine Democrats in voting to keep the resolution alive. The result highlighted fissures among Democrats about fulfilling President Biden’s request to send a fresh infusion of military aid to Israel, which some on the left say must be limited or otherwise conditioned on changing its approach to the war in Gaza. Mr. Sanders’s resolution is just one of a raft of measures that Senate progressives have proposed in recent weeks reflecting their uneasiness with Israel’s conduct of the war and raising questions about whether and under what circumstances the United States would send funding to back the country. “This is a tragedy in which we, the United States of America, are complicit,” Mr. Sanders said on the floor, pointing out that Israel’s bombardment of Gaza was more intensive than the bombing of Dresden in World War II, and had put the local population at risk of famine.

ByAdam Goldman,Ronen Bergman,Patrick KingsleyandGal Koplewitz Reporting from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and Washington One tunnel in Gaza was wide enough for a top Hamas official to drive a car inside. Another stretched nearly three football fields long and was hidden beneath a hospital. Under the house of a senior Hamas commander, the Israeli military found a spiral staircase leading to a tunnel approximately seven stories deep. These details and new information about the tunnels, some made public by the Israeli military and documented by video and photographs, underscore why the tunnels were considered a major threat to the Israeli military in Gaza even before the war started. But Israeli officials and soldiers who have since been in the tunnels — as well as current and former American officials with experience in the region — say the scope, depth and quality of the tunnels built by Hamas have astonished them. Even some of the machinery that Hamas used to build the tunnels, observed in captured videos, has surprised the Israeli military. The Israeli military now believes there are far more tunnels under Gaza. In December, the network was assessed to be an estimated 250 miles. Senior Israeli defense officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, are currently estimating the network is between 350 and 450 miles — extraordinary figures for a territory that at its longest point is only 25 miles. Two of the officials also assessed there are close to 5,700 separate shafts leading down to the tunnels. The numbers could not be independently verified, and there are varying estimates by Israeli officials for the increased scope of the tunnel network, based on different intelligence. But the immense efforts of Hamas to militarize the enclave are not in dispute; nor are the intelligence failures of the Israeli military in underestimating the extent and importance of the network to Hamas’s survival. In a meeting in January 2023, a top Israeli military official said the tunnels would not even be a factor in any future war with Hamas because of Israel’s military strength, according to a transcript of the discussion reviewed by The New York Times.

ByNatan Odenheimer Natan Odenheimer accompanied two Palestinian brothers as they retraced the last known steps of a third brother who was captured by Hamas during its raid on southern Israel on Oct. 7. On a clear December morning, two Palestinian brothers stood on a mound in southern Israel that overlooked Gaza, watching smoke rise after Israeli airstrikes. It was a conflicted moment for the men, Abd Al-Mughani Abu Amar, 37, and Mahmood Abu Amar, 24. They live in East Jerusalem, and were thinking of their relatives in Hamas-controlled Gaza, whom they had not heard from in weeks. But the brothers had been drawn to the Gaza border for another reason: Their youngest brother, Soheib Abu Amar, a bus driver, wascaptured by Hamason Oct. 7, taken after he drove Israeli partygoers toa music festivalthe night before. His brothers had come to retrace Mr. Abu Amar’s last known steps. Some two million Arabs live in Israel, roughly a fifth of the country’s population of more than nine million. Several were among the 1,200 people killed by Hamas on Oct 7. For Mr. Abu Amar’s brothers, the days since his abduction have been filled with bewildering emotions. As Palestinians, their hearts are with Gazans suffering under the unrelenting Israeli bombardment. But Mr. Abu Amar’s killing has also made them share in Israel’s trauma.

ByMatthew Mpoke Bigg,Vivek ShankarandThomas Fuller Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen have launched a fresh round of attacks in shipping lanes critical for global trade, damaging a U.S.-owned commercial ship on Monday after attempting to hit an American warship the day before. The strikes came just days after the U.S. and British militaries unleashed a powerful barrage on militant sites in Yemen, and the Houthi response made clear how difficult it might prove to remove the threat posed to shipping in and around the Red Sea. U.S. forces are bracing for much larger retaliatory attacks from the Houthis, who began targeting ships after the war in the Gaza Strip began and are preparing escalating responses, senior U.S. military officials said. After the United States and Britain hit more than 60 Houthi targets last week with more than 150 precision-guided munitions, U.S. officials said the militants still retained about three-quarters of their ability to fire missiles and drones at ships transiting the Red Sea. Many of their weapons systems are on mobile platforms and can be readily moved or hidden, the officials said. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain, nevertheless, said on Monday that the airstrikes had achieved their objectives and showed that Britain was “prepared to back our words with actions.” Speaking in Parliament, Mr. Sunak described the strikes as “limited, not escalatory” and a “necessary and proportionate response to a direct threat.” Britain’s defense secretary, Grant Shapps, told Sky News: “We never thought that this would remove all of their facilities.

One person was killed and 17 others injured, according to emergency officials. Both assailants, residents of the Hebron area in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, were arrested, the police said in a statement. Their motivations were still being investigated, but the incident was being treated as a terrorist attack, according to Dean Elsdunne, a spokesman for the police. Magen David Adom, an Israeli emergency medical service, said a woman in her 70s was killed. Of the 17 people wounded, two were in serious condition, it said. The French foreign ministry said two of those injured were young French nationals, but it gave no names or ages. “Nothing justifies terrorism,” the ministry’s statement said. The incident, in the town of Ra’anana, came amid heightened tensions in Israel, as the war against Hamas in Gaza has entered its fourth month and as Israeli security forces have tightened restrictions on Palestinians in the West Bank. Avi Bitton, the police commander for Israel’s central district, told reporters that the suspects had used two cars to carry out “a series of rammings.” In a statement, Hamas offered praise for what it described as “the ‘Ra’anana’ attack,” referring to the assailants as “heroes” and calling their actions “a natural response to the occupation’s massacres and aggression against the Palestinian people.” It did not take responsibility for the incident. The Shin Bet, Israel’s internal intelligence agency, identified the suspects as Ahmad Zidat, 25, and Mahmoud Zidat, 44. It said they were members of the same family from the village of Bani Naim, and that they were among the Palestinians who are barred from entering Israel.

In total, 26 people were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and impeding vehicular traffic, according to a statement from the police. The police first responded to reports of protest activity outside the airport, along the Van Wyck Expressway, around 11:30 a.m., according to the authorities, and the roadway was cleared 20 minutes later. The Port Authority sent two airport buses to offer rides to travelers affected by the backup, according to the police. During the demonstration, the protesters held hands, forming a line that stretched across the highway, and they carried banners with messages including “Divest From Genocide,” “Let Gaza Live” and “Right to Return.” Behind them, bumper-to-bumper traffic stretched as far as the eye could see across all three lanes. About an hour later and 2,500 miles west, pro-Palestinian protesters blocked traffic on West Century Boulevard near the entrance to Los Angeles International Airport. Thirty-five people were arrested, according to the police, most of them on charges of rioting. By midmorning, crews were removing debris that demonstrators had placed across the roadway.

The twin specters ofa widening regional warand intensified suffering of civilians loomed over the Middle East on Saturday, after the Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen threatened to respond to American airstrikes and a senior U.N. official warned that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza washurtling toward famine. An American missile strike, launched from a warship in the Red Sea, hit a radar station outside the Yemeni capital, Sana, early Saturday. The solitary strike came about 24 hours after a much wider barrage ofU.S.-led strikesagainstnearly 30 sites in northern and western Yementhat were intended to deter Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. Houthi officials tried to brush off the latest assault, saying it would have little impact on their ability to continue those attacks. Their stated goal is to punish Israel for blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza — though Yemeni analysts say the crisis alsopresents the Houthis with a welcome distractionfrom rising criticism at home. Two U.S. officials cautioned on Saturday that even after hitting more than 60 missile and drone targets with more than 150 precision-guided munitions, the U.S.-led airstrikes damaged or destroyed only about 20 to 30 percent of the Houthis’ offensive capability, much of which is mounted on mobile platforms and can be readily moved or hidden. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal military assessments, said that U.S. analysts have been rushing to catalog potential Houthi targets, but that doing so has proved challenging. Western intelligence agencies have not spent significant time or resources in recent years collecting data on Houthi air defenses, command hubs or munitions depots, they said. The greater risk from the air attacks is likely borne by ordinary Yemenis, whose impoverished nation has beencrushedby years of civil war, and who now face a high-stakes confrontation that imperils a fragile 20-month truce. Some 21 million Yemenis, or two-thirds of the population, rely on aid to survive, in what the United Nations has calledone of the world’s worst humanitarian calamities— a dubious distinction now shared by Gaza.

ByJulian E. BarnesandAdam Goldman Reporting from Washington and Tel Aviv The C.I.A. is collecting information on senior Hamas leaders and the location of hostages in Gaza, and is providing that intelligence to Israel as it carries out its war in the enclave, according to U.S. officials. A new task force assembled in the days after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terror attacks on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and some 240 taken hostage back in Gaza, has uncovered information on Hamas’s top leaders, according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence assessments. Immediately after the Oct. 7 attack, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, sent a memo to the intelligence agencies and Defense Department ordering the task force’s creation and directing increased intelligence collection on Hamas’s leadership, officials said. The establishment of the task force has not created any new legal authorities, but the White House raised the priority of collecting intelligence on Hamas. It is not clear how valuable the information has been to Israel, though none of the most senior leaders of Hamas has been captured or killed. The United States is not providing Israel with intelligence on low or midlevel Hamas operatives. Israel had estimated before Oct. 7 that Hamas had 20,000 to 25,000 fighters. By the end of 2023, Israel had told American officials they believed they had killed roughly a third of that force. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Blinken conducted marathon diplomacy around the region, but Israeli leaders, focused on war with Hamas, showed no interest in meeting demands like Palestinian statehood. ByEdward WongandPatrick Kingsley Edward Wong reported from nine countries while traveling for the past week with the U.S. secretary of state, and Patrick Kingsley reported from Jerusalem. As Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken stood on the tarmac of an airport in Cairo on Thursday before flying back to the United States, he expressed confidence in the support he said he had gotten from leaders across the Middle East for a vision of postwar Gaza, eventually including a Palestinian state alongside Israel. “None of this will happen overnight,” he said at the end of a week of high-stakes diplomacy with 10 governments. “But there is a greater willingness now for countries to make the hard decisions, to do what’s necessary to advance on that track.” But however much ground Mr. Blinken may have gained in hisconversations with Arab and Turkish leaders, the one government that matters most in the equation — Israel’s — has given no sign that it is aligned with the Biden administration’s long-term goals. The Israelis are interested in forging full diplomatic relations with powerful Arab states like Saudi Arabia, but they remain publicly dismissive of a critical American and Arab demand: the creation of a Palestinian state. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his aides are focused on the war in Gaza against Hamas. “Today, no one can speak with Israelis about a Palestinian state,” Danny Danon, a senior lawmaker from Mr. Netanyahu’s party, said in an interview. “Today, we have to look at stability, security.” Over the course of his trip, Mr. Blinken repeatedly said that now is the moment to forge a political solution, however difficult and ambitious, to the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The burst of violence on Oct. 7, when an estimated 1,200 people were killed in a Hamas-led attack, and the failure that day of the Israeli government to protect its citizens, show that Israel cannot rely solely on its security apparatus to guard its safety, other U.S. officials say.

Israel has categorically denied the accusation. transcript “Israel has a genocidal intent against the Palestinians in Gaza. That is evident from the way in which Israel’s military attack is being conducted. The mass displacement of the population of Gaza headed into areas where they continue to be killed.” “The level of Israel’s killing is so extensive that nowhere is safe in Gaza.” “I think we have seen today one of the biggest shows of hypocrisy in history when South Africa became the legal arm of a terror organization, Hamas.” “Bring them home. Bring them home.” “Free Palestine, free, free Palestine.” ByRoni Caryn Rabin,Hiba YazbekandThomas Fuller After three months besieging and bombarding the Gaza Strip in its war against Hamas, Israel faced a charge of genocide at the International Court of Justice on Thursday, as South Africa argued that Israel “means to create conditions of death” in Gaza, and demanded the court order an emergency suspension of the military campaign. Presenting their case to a packed courtroom in The Hague, South African lawyers offered as evidence the words of Israeli officials, including Defense MinisterYoav Gallant, whosaidin October that Israel would impose acomplete siegeon the territory because it was fighting “human animals.” Israel categorically denies the genocide accusation, and is set to present its defense on Friday, the second part of the two-day hearing in the United Nations’ top judicial body. The hearings will be the first time that Israel has chosen to defend itself in person in such a setting, a sign of the high stakes of the moment, with Israel’s international reputation falling around much of the world over its campaign’s toll in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel described the proceedings on Thursday as “an upside-down world,” in which his country faced such charges. “Israel is accused of genocide at a time when it is fighting against genocide,” he said, referring to the war in Gaza, which began after Hamas and other armed groups carried out attacks on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people and led to about 240 being taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. Genocide is among the most serious crimes of which a country can be accused, and the allegation carries particular significance in Israel, founded after the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust. While the South African government maintains that it is pursuing its case to stop a genocide, analysts say it is also motivated by longstanding domestic support for the Palestinian cause dating to the presidency of Nelson Mandela, a fervent supporter of Palestinian rights.

","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by Universities are under tremendous pressure to stamp out antisemitism, but some say that is causing fear and curbing free expression. ByVimal PatelandAnna Betts At the University of Pennsylvania, approval for the screening of a documentary critical of Israel was denied. At Brandeis University — which expressed a publiccommitment to free speech— a pro-Palestinian student group was barred for statements made by its national chapter. At the University of Vermont, a Palestinian poet was set to deliver a talk, but the school pulled the meeting space after students complained he was antisemitic. There are growing signs that colleges are starting to clamp down on pro-Palestinian protests and events on campus, as the institutions facepressure from donors, alumni andpoliticians, who are furious over what they say is an antisemitic campaign against Jews. Some schools have simply canceled events, or delayed them. A handful of schools have shut down student groups and disciplined students. Some students have simply stopped participating in protests, concerned for their own safety, spooked by alumni who have started do-not-hire lists and outside groups that have doxxed students. The war in the Middle East is laying bare the difficulties American universities are confronting innavigating free expression.Already under attack in recent years from conservatives forclosing off debate on other topics, university leaders are now struggling to balance open expression withfears and complaints from some Jewish studentsthat the language of pro-Palestinian protest calls for violence against them.

ByVivian Yee,Adam SellaandRoni Caryn Rabin Vivian Yee reported from Cairo, Adam Sella from the Kerem Shalom border crossing, and Roni Caryn Rabin from Tel Aviv. The trucks carrying aid for Gaza stop for exhaustive inspections by Israeli authorities. They can pass through two border crossings only during limited hours. Inside the territory, vehicles travel over a landscape of rubble and ruined roads to distribute the aid to desperate, hungry crowds. These obstacles are contributing to a growing humanitarian crisis, according to aid officials and two U.S. senators who recently visited Rafah, one of the two crossings into Gaza that is open for aid trucks. Aid groups and the U.N. warn thatthe risk of famine is widening, that the territory’shealth care system is collapsingand that contagiousdiseases are spreading rapidly. Israel has been bombarding and besieging Gaza since Oct. 7, when Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups raided Israel, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. The war has damaged the roads the trucks use to travel and crippled the communications networks that are essential for coordinating aid distribution. Israel’s siege has dried up almost all the fuel and cut off electricity. Fighting and Israeli airstrikes have killed about 23,000 people in Gaza, according to health officials in Gaza, including more than 150 aid workers, according to the U.N. and aid groups, who say the war prevents others from being able to report for duty. Aid groups say the trucks sometimes come under fire from Israeli forces, despite their efforts to coordinate the convoys with the Israeli military in advance. “The humanitarian community has been left with the impossible mission of supporting more than two million people, even as its own staff are being killed and displaced, as communication blackouts continue, as roads are damaged and convoys are shot at,” Martin Griffiths, the top U.N. humanitarian chief, said in a statement last week.

ByEdward Wong reporting from Tel Aviv and Manama, Bahrain Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, met on Wednesday with Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, to discuss Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza and the role that the authority might play there when the conflict ebbs. Mr. Blinken traveled in a convoy from Tel Aviv in Israel to Ramallah, the seat of the authority, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The two men shook hands at the authority’s headquarters and sat down for talks with their aides. The Biden administration has said it envisions a role for the Palestinian Authority in governing both the West Bank and Gaza. Hamas took control of the tiny coastal strip in 2007 and violently drove out Fatah, the group now in charge of the authority in the West Bank. President Biden has also said Israel must allow for the formation of a Palestinian state, arguing that a political solution is the only way out of the decades-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Mr. Blinkenreiterated that viewin a news conference in Tel Aviv on Tuesday after meetings with Israeli officials. He also said Saudi Arabia — whose ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he met with on Monday — was still willing to consider establishing normal diplomatic relations with Israel, but only if Israel agreed to concrete steps toward the establishment of a free and independent Palestine. In their meeting, Mr. Abbas told Mr. Blinken that the Palestinians would not accept what he called Israeli plans to keep Gaza separate from the West Bank, according to Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency. “The Gaza Strip is part and parcel of the state of Palestine,” the agency quoted him as saying. Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, and his right-wing government have rejected the notion of a Palestinian state, and Mr. Netanyahusaid years agothat Israeli officials should support a strong Hamas in Gaza in order to undermine the Palestinian Authority and the idea of a unified Palestine.

ByIsabel KershnerandJohn Eligon Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem and John Eligon from Johannesburg The International Court of Justice, the United Nations’ highest judicial body, will begin hearings this week in a case brought by South Africa that accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. The hearings, the first step in a lengthy process should the case go forward, will be the first time that Israel has chosen to defend itself, in person, in such a setting, attesting to the gravity of the indictment and the high stakes for its international reputation and standing. Genocide, the term first employed by a Polish lawyer of Jewish descent in 1944 to describe the Nazis’ systematic murder of about six million Jews and others based on their ethnicity, is among the most serious crimes of which a country can be accused. In its submission to the court, South Africa cited that lawyer, Raphael Lemkin, expounding on the definition of genocide. South Africa, whose post-apartheid government has long supported the Palestinian cause, accused Israel of actions in Gaza that are “genocidal in character.” It says Israel has killed Palestinian civilians, inflicted serious bodily and mental harm, and created for the residents of Gaza “conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction.” More than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed over the past three months, a majority of them women and children, according to health officials in Gaza. And most of the enclave’s 2.2 million residents have been displaced since the war began, increasing the danger of disease andhunger, according to international organizations. The allegation, which Israel categorically denies, is laden with a particular significance in Israel, a country founded in the wake of the near wholesale destruction of European Jewry and that soon after became a haven for Jews expelled by the hundreds of thousands from Arab lands.

ByPatrick KingsleyandJohnatan Reiss reporting from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv With a vast chasm between how Israelis see the war in Gaza and how much of the world does, Israel’s leaders have taken to adopting different rhetoric when addressing the two audiences about how its military campaign against Hamas will be conducted over the year ahead. Israeli officials have begun to tell the international news media that its forces are shifting toa less intense phaseof operations, particularly in northern Gaza, amid international alarm at thescale of destructionand civilian casualties in the territory. But after those comments were published on Monday, Israeli leaders sought to reassure the Israeli public that they remained committed to a long-term war in Gaza to destroy Hamas, even if the military tactics are shifting. The messages are not incompatible, analysts say: The pace of a war can ebb without the conflict ending. But they say the differing rhetoric reflects the Israeli government’s effort to placate an international audience in the short term, in order to pursue its goals over the long term. At home, the government must answer to a population, traumatized by the brutality of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, that still wants the government to follow through with its promise to end Hamas’s control of the Gaza Strip. But to do that, Israel must retain some level of international legitimacy, especially if it wants to sustain the support of its primary backer, the United States. The top U.S. diplomat, Antony J. Blinken, visited Israel on Tuesday amid growing pressure on the Biden administration to push for a cease-fire. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

A destroyed Palestinian house in the central Gaza Strip on Monday.Credit... Supported by ByPatrick Kingsley Photographs byAvishag Shaar-Yashuv Patrick Kingsley, a reporter, and Avishag Shaar-Yashuv, a photographer, traveled with Israeli troops to document the effects of the war in Gaza. For a few fleeting moments, the two-story house on the edge of Bureij, a ruined town in central Gaza, still felt like a Palestinian home. Bottles of nail polish, perfume and hair gel stood untouched on a shelf. A collection of fridge magnets decorated the frame of a mirror. Through a window, one could see laundry, hanging from a neighbor’s washing line, swaying in the gentle breeze. But despite the trappings of home, the house now has a new function — as a makeshift Israeli military barracks. Since Israeli ground forces recently fought their way into this part of central Gaza, a unit from the military’s 188th Brigade has taken over the building, using it as a dormitory, storeroom and lookout point. On Monday, some soldiers were awaiting orders in the ground-floor living room, or standing watch on the terrace above. One bedroom was crowded with the soldiers’ backpacks and equipment. The house's walls were marred with Hebrew graffiti. “The people of Israel,” read one message, written in black spray paint. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByIsabel Kershner,Edward WongandThomas Fuller JERUSALEM — As the war in the Gaza Strip ended its third month on Sunday, with top diplomats touring the region to try to stop the conflict from spreading, Israel said it had broken up Hamas’s command structure in northern Gaza and signaled that it would not change its objective of dismantling the group’s capabilities across the ravaged territory. “The war must not be stopped until we achieve all of its goals — eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting. His message, he said, was intended for “both our enemies and our friends.” Fears of a wider war have added urgency to visits to the region by the American secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, and the European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell Fontelles. Early Sunday, even as diplomats were working to stop the fighting from spreading more broadly, a spike in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank left about a dozen people dead, among them nine Palestinians, including a young child, an Israeli border police officer and a man from East Jerusalem, officials said. Cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia in Lebanon, has also become a point of increasing concern. “This is a moment of profound tension in the region,” Mr. Blinken said at a news conference in Doha, Qatar, where he travelled on Sunday after a stop in Jordan. “This is a conflict that could easily metastasize, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering.” “We have intense focus on preventing this conflict from spreading,” Mr. Blinken told reporters on Saturday, a day before meeting in Jordan with King Abdullah II. The king said he had warned the secretary of state about “catastrophic ramifications” if the war continues. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Hamza al-Dahdouh, the son of Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief, and a second reporter were killed in what officials in the territory said was an Israeli airstrike. Two others were wounded. ByVivian YeeandAmeera Harouda Wael al-Dahdouh, a well-known Palestinian correspondent for Al Jazeera TV who has spent his career covering Gaza, hadalready losthis wife, a son, a daughter and an infant grandson in an Israeli airstrike in October. On Sunday, he lost another member of his family to the war: his eldest son, Hamza, was killed in an Israeli airstrike that left two journalists dead and wounded two others, according to the authorities in Gaza. The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, reported that an Israeli drone strike hit the car Hamza al-Dahdouh was traveling in west of the southern city of Khan Younis. He was killed along with another journalist, Mustafa Thuraya. Two others, Ahmed Al-Burash and Amer Abu Amr, were injured. Wael al-Dahdouh said his son was working for Al Jazeera at the time of his death. Wafa reported that the two injured men worked for Palestine Today, a TV channel. Photos from news agencies of the attack’s aftermath showed a burned-out sedan that was missing its windshield and most of its roof and hood. In a video apparently taken shortly after Sunday’s airstrike and shared with journalists on WhatsApp, a crowd gathers around the car. Someone throws a blanket over a body in the driver’s seat, while others carry another person from the passenger side. “Nothing is harder than the pain of loss. And when you experience this pain time after time, it becomes harder and more severe,” Wael al-Dahdouh told Al Jazeera after his son’s death. He added: “I wish that the blood of my son Hamza will be the last from journalists and the last from people here in Gaza, and for this massacre to stop.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByHiba Yazbek,Ephrat LivniandAaron Boxerman As Israeli troops pulled out after a two-and-a-half-day incursion into the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry said on Thursday that the raid had killed at least 12 people and wounded 34 others. Israeli raids into the West Bank have become much more frequent since the war with Hamas began more than two months ago in Gaza, with dozens made in that time, and this one was unusually long and deadly. Jenin and its refugee camp, strongholds of Palestinian armed resistance, have been common targets. The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had disciplined three soldiers involved in filming themselves while one or more of them sang a Jewish prayer inside a mosque in Jenin. Videos of the incident, a potentially inflammatory show of disrespect, circulated widely online. Residents reported seeing Israeli military vehicles leaving Jenin on Thursday afternoon. The military in a statement said it had completed “a 60-hour-long extensive operation in the Jenin refugee camp and in the city of Jenin.” It reported detaining “14 wanted suspects, including three affiliated with Hamas,” as well as some 60 others, and said it had “eliminated 10 terrorists.” The Palestinian Prisoners Club, a nongovernmental rights group, put the number of Palestinians arrested in the raid at more than 100. Seven Israeli soldiers were lightly injured in the operation, which the military said had “exposed more than 10 underground facilities, dozens of rifles” and seven explosives labs. The raid included an Israeli drone strike on Tuesday that the military said killed several people who had fired on Israeli forces. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByAdam Sella Adam Sella visited the University of Haifa, speaking with dozens of students, faculty and staff. In a classroom at the University of Haifa in late December, Yitzhak Cohen, a fourth-year law student, began the shoulder-shrugging, arm-contorting choreography familiar to any student trying to remove a backpack. But instead of a knapsack, Mr. Cohen, 28, a reservist who had recently returned from fighting in Gaza to attend the university’s orientation, unshouldered his military-issue Tavor assault rifle and took a seat in the back of the class. Nearly three months after the outbreak of war delayed universities’ start dates, students returned on Dec. 31 to campuses in Israel for an abridged semester. Amid the usual first-day jitters, students and faculty were additionally anxious about resuming classes during a war that had unsettled the country, Jews and Arabs alike. At the University of Haifa, a uniquely mixed institution where more than 40 percent of students are Arabs, those anxieties are amplified by what is among the school’s proudest achievements — its diversity. For the first time since the outbreak of the war, Jewish students, some of whom had spent the past months fighting in Gaza or lost friends and family inthe Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, rubbed shoulders with Arab students. And some of those Arab students had relatives killed in Gaza or had been targeted and silenced on social media because of their views on the war. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

He was killed during intense Israeli bombardment near his family home, his father and mother said, and in the days that followed, it was too dangerous to step outside and lay their 10-year-old child to rest. His family called the Palestine Red Crescent for help. But it was the early days of Israel’s ground invasion in northern Gaza, and forces were blocking streets with tanks and gunfire, preventing rescue workers from reaching those killed by Israeli airstrikes. Each day, the father, Hazem Sabawi, suffered a double torment — mourning his son and unable to afford him the final dignity of a proper burial. “After the fourth day, I said that’s it. Either I will be buried with him, or I won’t bury him at all,” he said, recounting how he laid his son under a guava tree behind a neighbor’s apartment building. “Every human has the right to be buried,” Mr. Sabawi said. It has been 13 weeks since Israel’s war in Gaza began after the attack on Israel by Hamas, which killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. Since then, the living in Gaza have been forced to inter their dead hurriedly and without ceremony or last rites, lest they risk the same fate as their loved ones. More than 22,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since Oct. 7, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Civilians are being killed at a pace with fewprecedentsin this century. The conflict has turned Gaza into a “graveyard for thousands of children,” the United Nations said. “The situation has gotten to the point where we say: The lucky are those who have someone to bury them when they die,” said Dr. Mohammad Abu Moussa, a radiologist at Al-Nasr Hospital in southern Gaza.

Blinken returned to the Middle East on Friday in an effort to ease escalating tensions. ByRoni Rabin,Euan WardandHwaida Saad Roni Rabin reported from Tel Aviv, and Euan Ward and Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Lebanon. As Secretary of StateAntony J. Blinken returned to the Middle Easton Friday in an effort to ease escalating tensions, Israel’s defense minister floated a postwar plan for the Gaza Strip that exposed divisions in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s wartime government. The proposal by the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who is a moderate member of Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, was widely seen as a trial balloon, but it showed the pressure Israel was facing as Washington and others press for a shift to a less intense phase of the war. Further complicating diplomatic efforts in the region, Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the powerful armed group Hezbollah, which has been clashing with Israeli forces along the Israeli-Lebanese border, on Friday ruled out any negotiations to stop the fighting until the war in Gaza ended. Mr. Gallant’s proposal, shared on Thursday at a stormy meeting of the Israeli security cabinet, is predicated on the military’s defeat of Hamas in Gaza. It calls for Israel to maintain military control of Gaza’s borders while a “multinational task force” oversees reconstruction and economic development in the territory, which has been devastated by nearly three months of relentless Israeli airstrikes. Under the plan, Gazans who do not have ties to Hamas, which runs Gaza and has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, would handle civilian affairs in the enclave, according to details of the cabinet meeting leaked to the Israeli news media. But there would be no role for the Palestinian Authority, which runs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and there would be no resettlement of Israelis in Gaza — an idea that far-right Israelis support.

Ms. Pritzker sounded weary, and it was posed as an open question, two people with knowledge of the conversation said. But Dr. Gay understood what it meant. Her six-month tenure as Harvard’s president was over. On Jan. 2, sheannounced her resignation. That marked the end of one of the most tumultuous periods in Harvard’s 387-year history, a controversy that thrust the school into the public debate after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s subsequent invasion of Gaza. Not only did the university’s president lose her job, but thesecretive workings of its board, the Harvard Corporation, were laid bare. For weeks the board had stood by its embattled president as she dealt with withering criticism of her tepid response to antisemitism on campus, her disastrous testimony before a House panel and mounting allegations of plagiarism in her academic work. Ms. Pritzker, who had led the selection of Dr. Gay as the school’s first Black president, was an especially ardent backer. On Dec. 12, the corporationput out a statementin support of Dr. Gay, citing “our confidence that President Gay is the right leader to help our community heal and to address the very serious societal issues we are facing.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByEdward WongandMichael Crowley Reporting from aboard the U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s airplane to the Middle East and from Washington Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is returning to the Middle East this week with the goals of getting Israel to curtail attacks that are killing thousands of Palestinian civilians and preventing the war from spreading across the region. But previously unreported details of a clash between Mr. Blinken and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel point to the challenges ahead. During a private meeting in November, Mr. Blinken told Mr. Netanyahu that the Israelis would have to agree to a series of pauses in the fighting in Gaza to let more aid flow into the war zone and to allow civilians to leave areas under attack. Mr. Netanyahu refused, U.S. officials said on the condition of anonymity to describe the private conversation in Jerusalem. Mr. Blinken then said he would announce the Biden administration’s demand in a news conference, which prompted Mr. Netanyahu to scramble to pre-empt him by issuing a defiantstatement by video. “I told him, ‘We swore and I swore to eliminate Hamas,’” Mr. Netanyahu said. “Nothing will stop us.” The Israeli military started doing pauses of about four hours at a time in a few areas within days of the diplomatic clash, despite Mr. Netanyahu’s bluster. That episode on Nov. 3 brings into sharp relief theevolving relationshipbetween the United States and its most important partner in the Middle East, a relationship that President Biden has charged Mr. Blinken with shepherding during a spiraling crisis.

Mr. Nasrallahreiterated a message from his speech Wednesday, when he vowed that Hezbollah would avengethe killing of a Hamas leader, Saleh al-Arouri— a man he described as a “dear friend” — in a suburb of Beirut, the Lebanese capital. Mr. al-Arouri was the most senior Hamas figure to have been killed since Israel vowed to destroy the organization and eliminate its leadership after sweeping Hamas-led raids into Israel on Oct. 7. “This won’t go unpunished,” Mr. Nasrallah said Friday. “We cannot stay silent. ” As he did on Wednesday, Mr. Nasrallah did not say exactly how, or when, his group would respond to the assassination. And although clashes have been intensifying along the Israel-Lebanon border, none so far have signaled a marked escalation. Israel has not publicly accepted or denied responsibility for the killing, but two senior Lebanese security officials, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss an active investigation, said that Israel had carried out the attack using six missiles, two of which did not explode. Lebanon’s caretaker government has submitted a complaint to the U.N. Security Council over the killing of Mr. al-Arouri, calling it the “most dangerous phase” yet amid the escalating conflict, according to a statement. As he closed his remarks, Mr. Nasrallah appeared to acknowledge this new chapter. “The war today is not only for the sake of Palestine, it is also for Lebanon,” he said.

ByAmelia Nierenberg Reporting from New Haven, Conn. Yale University leaders, elected officials and clergy in New Haven, Conn., condemned what they called the desecration of a public Hanukkah menorah after a protester briefly hung a Palestinian flag from it over the weekend. “The placement of a Palestinian flag on the menorah conveys a deeply antisemitic message to Jewish residents of New Haven, including members of the Yale community,” Peter Salovey, the Yale president, said in a statement. Senator Richard Blumenthal, who is Jewish, called the incident an act of hate and described his father’s escape from Germany in 1935. “It may look like a prank,” he said appearing at a news conference in New Haven on Monday. “It may look like a joke. But it couldn’t be more serious because it is the mockery and desecration of a profoundly important religious symbol.” The incident, captured on video in a public space near the Yale campus but not on it, lasted little more than a minute, according to a participant in a pro-Palestinian rally nearby. The protester who hung the flag quickly removed it at the urging of other demonstrators. “Get down!” the demonstrators can be heard shouting repeatedly in the video. “That looks bad for us,” said one person in akaffiyeh, a scarf that symbolizes Palestinian liberation. “Take it down!” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByIsabel Kershner reporting from Jerusalem Under the cover of the war in Gaza, Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank have carried out a “surge” of unauthorized moves to expand their footprint in the territory, according to a report by Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy group that opposes settlements and tracks their progress. Peace Now’s settlement watch team said it had recorded the establishment of nine new so-called wildcat settlement outposts, not authorized by the Israeli government, which appear to be mostly made up of temporary structures. The team also said it documented the creation of more than a dozen new dirt paths and roads. In addition, the report found, settlers have been fencing off open areas in the part of the West Bank that is under complete Israeli control in order to block access to Palestinian herders. Several of the outposts and roads are on privately owned Palestinian land, the report said, in violation of Israeli law. The activities add fuel to what are already unusually high tensions in the West Bank, where violence and Israeli military raids have spiraled over the past year. Palestinian militias have carried out shooting attacks against Israelis; frequent raids by the Israeli military have produced thousands of arrests and have often turned deadly; and extremist Jewish settlers have rampaged through Palestinian villages, setting fire to property. While the settler actions documented by Peace Now are not approved by Israel, the far-right coalition that took power in December 2022 supports settlement expansion, and includes extremist settlers who want to annex some or all of the West Bank. Israel has in the past retroactively authorized settlements it had previously seen as illegal. Most countries view all settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem to be a violation of international law. Israel captured those areas from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians see that land as part of a future independent state, made steadily less viable by settler expansion. “The three months of war in Gaza are being exploited by settlers to establish facts on the ground,” Peace Now said in a statement, citing what it described as a “permissive military and political environment” that allowed land seizure to go “almost unchecked, with minimal adherence to the law.” Isabel Kershner, a correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian politics since 1990.

ByJeremy W. Peters As the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania were pushed out of their jobs in recent weeks, it was an open question whether the president of another prestigious institution, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, would suffer the same fate. But Sally Kornbluth, who testified alongside her two colleagues in a tense congressional hearing last month on antisemitism, has avoided much of the ire directed at Claudine Gay,who resignedthis week as Harvard’s president, and Elizabeth Magill, whostepped downas Penn’s president just a few days after her testimony. Some are still calling for Dr. Kornbluth’s resignation, including Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the Republican who led the most pointed questioning at the hearing. But Dr. Kornbluth has so far not faced the kind of concerted effort from angry donors and alumni that helped bring down the other university presidents. Notably, an organization of Jewish alumni at M.I.T. that has been critical of the university for not doing enough to address antisemitism on campus — and criticized the congressional testimony as “disastrous” — has not called for Dr. Kornbluth’s resignation. Matt Handel, a founder of the M.I.T. Jewish Alumni Alliance, said he believes it is more constructive to work with the university administration than to begin demanding people lose their jobs. He and the alliance have taken other steps to register their discontent, including encouraging alumni to reduce their annual donations to $1. “As alumni, we are dissatisfied with the approach the administration is taking,” Mr. Handel said in an interview. But, he added, “We as an organization are still trying to facilitate change in culture and policy.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMegan Specia Reporting from Dublin Under the light drizzle of a Tuesday morning last month, Ríonach Ní Néill and a group of friends set up a small platform in front of the United States Embassy in Dublin. Then they took out a stack of papers. For the next 11 and a half hours, Ms. Ní Néill and others took turns reading out thousands of names — each one a person killed since Israel started bombarding Gaza in the war, according to a list released by the Gazan health authorities. It was an attempt to convey the enormity of the loss of life, she said. “I think the baseline really in Ireland is that human rights are valued, and what’s happening now is the destruction of universal human rights,” said Ms. Ní Néill, 52, an artist from Galway. “This is not something that can be ignored.” In Ireland, support for Palestinian civilians runs deep, rooted in what many see as a shared history of British colonialism and the experience of a seemingly intractable and traumatic conflict, which in Ireland’s case came to a close with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Since the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people, according to the Israeli authorities, and the subsequent bombardment of Gaza, Ireland has emerged as something of an outlier in Europe for its stance on the conflict. While condemning the Hamas atrocities, lawmakers across Ireland’s political spectrum were among the first in Europe to call for the protection of Palestinian civilians and denounce the scale of Israel’s response, which has left more than 15,000 people dead, according to health officials in Gaza — a rate of casualtieswith few precedents in the 21st century.

ByDana Goldstein Some public school educators in Oakland, Calif., presented pro-Palestinian lessons on Wednesday as part of an unauthorized teach-in. The school district said this week that it opposed the event, and some Jewish groups and parents condemned it and called for teachers who participated to be disciplined. The teach-in was organized by a group of activists within the local teachers’ union, the Oakland Education Association. But the union president, Ismael Armendariz, emphasized that the materials had not been reviewed by his group. The event’s anonymous organizers createda lengthy listof suggested curriculum materials for all grade levels, from pre-K through high school. The document calls Israel an “apartheid state” and refers to “the historic and unfolding oppression and genocide of Palestinians.” Nate Landry, 40, a parent in the district who is acting as a spokesman for the organizers, said teacherssaw the proposed curriculumas “a corrective” to mainstream education materials that take a pro-Israel view.

ByEuan Ward,Roni Rabin,Hwaida SaadandMichael Levenson The journalists reported from Beirut, Lebanon; Tel Aviv; and New York. The border between Israel and Lebanon has become a landscape of abandoned towns and neglected farms as escalating tensions and tit-for-tat strikes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants have displaced more than 150,000 people in both countries. Prospects for an end to the cross-border hostilities have grown only dimmer since theassassination on Tuesday of a senior Hamas leaderin a suburb of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, fed growing fears of a wider war. The strike has been widely ascribed to Israel. In northern Israel, near the border with Lebanon, military orders to evacuate have kept people from their homes for nearly three months amid daily missile and rocket attacks by Hezbollah and other armed factions in Lebanon. The prolonged dislocation and economic fallout have increased pressure on the Israeli government to put an end to the attacks. transcript “This will take a very long time. That’s what everybody keeps saying to us. That’s what the messages that we’re receiving is that this — this will take months.” “It’s scary. I must say. We need to be sure that we’re safe in order to come and live here again in our homes.” “We have to just wait and hope for us to be able to return home.” “Every day people are being fired on,” said Moshe Davidovitz, who leads a regional council in the western Galilee region of northwestern Israel. “Every day they’re running into shelters. It’s intolerable, and it cannot continue. We can’t go on being ducks in a shooting range.” Many residents near the border work in agriculture and have been all but cut off from the farms, hothouses and chicken coops that are their livelihood, Mr. Davidovitz said. Day trips to tend to their farms are fraught with risk: One farmer, a father of three, was killed in a strike launched from Lebanon last month as he drove to his apple orchards in Mattat, just south of the border.

Human rights activists say the rules are good, but enforcement is lax. ByRoni Caryn Rabin Reporting from Jerusalem The news that three Israeli hostages were mistakenly shot and killed last month in Gaza by soldiers meant to save them outraged many in Israel, who have since demanded answers about how the army conducts itself on the battlefield and safeguards civilians. The three male hostages, captured by Hamas terrorists near the Gaza border on Oct. 7, were killed in Gaza City on Dec. 15. The men, aged 24, 26, and 28, were unarmed when they were shot. They had removed their shirts to reveal that their bodies were not strapped with explosives, and they were waving a makeshift white flag. A military investigation is underway, but immediately after the shootings, officials said the army’s rules of engagement had been violated. “The shooting of the hostages was carried out contrary to the open-fire regulations,” said Lt. Gen. Herzl Halevi, the Israeli military’s chief of staff. “Shooting at someone who raises a white flag and is seeking to surrender is absolutely prohibited.” The killings shocked Israelis, for whom the military is a revered national institution in which service for most adult citizens is compulsory. Israelis are taught as early as grade school about the “purity of arms” doctrine preached by the Israel Defense Forces — the idea that soldiers must never use their weapons or power to harm noncombatants. Every Israeli soldier carries in his or her pocket a printed copy of “Spirit of the I.D.F.,” guidelines that lay out the military’s values, said Nir Dinar, an army spokesman. While the deaths of the hostages brought questions about the military’s rules of engagement home to Israelis, human rights groups and the United Nations have said the military’s failures to properly enforce those rules most often apply to troops’ frequent interactions with Palestinians.

They pushed a false narrative of indifference and incompetence.” The painful and startling story of Dr. Gay’s brief presidency is igniting discussions of plagiarism, fairness, antisemitism and leadership. But also at its core is the unavoidable American question of race, and what role it plays in who gets ahead and how they are judged.

ByRoni Caryn Rabin Reporting from Tel Aviv A day after a blastkilled a senior Hamas leaderoutside Beirut, Lebanon, many Israelis welcomed the assassination as an important step in the campaign to destroy the militant group, but worried it might carry costs. Members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition in Israel, in particular, cheered the attack. “All those involved in the October massacre should know we’ll get to them, and we’ll settle the score,” declared Danny Danon, a member of Parliament from the Likud party. But some analysts said the killing of the Hamas official,Saleh al-Arouri, was likely to disrupt any negotiations over freeing more hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7 — which would be another setback for Israeli families waiting desperately for their relatives to come home. The assassination also prompted fears of a wider war in the Middle East and of retaliatory attacks in Israel. On Wednesday, the leader of the Lebanese-based militant group Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran, denounced the killing as a “dangerous” escalation and warned that Israel would “not go unpunished.” “If the enemy considers waging a war against Lebanon, our battle will be without boundaries or rules,” Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, said in a broadcast. “We are not afraid of war.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

A New York Times analysis of data on the Palestinians released showed that a majority of them had not been convicted of a crime. There were 107 teenagers under 18, including three girls. Another 66 teenagers were 18 years old. The oldest person released was a 64-year-old woman.

Ten women had been imprisoned for over six years. The oldest detainee was 64 years old. Sources: Israel Ministry of Justice, Israel Prison Service,  Palestinian Authority’s Commission for Prisoners’ Affairs By The New York Times The negotiations for the seven rounds of exchange — one for each day of the pause — had centered on women and children on either side of the conflict. Citizens of Thailand, the Philippines and Russia, who were freed through separate talks, also numbered among the hostages Hamas released. More than 120 hostages are believed to remain in Gaza. The Israeli government initially posted a list of 300 Palestinian teenagers and women who could potentially be released through the deal, and added 50 names to that list as the exchanges progressed. The list included people’s birth dates, the accusations levied against them and other information. Among those who had not been convicted of a crime, it did not distinguish between those imprisoned without formally being charged and those who had been charged and were awaiting trial. The New York Times compared the Israeli data with lists of the Palestinians released each day by the Palestinian Authority’s Commission for Prisoners’ Affairs. The Israeli data shows that three-quarters of the released Palestinians had not been convicted of a crime. Most had been in prison for less than a year; 37 were arrested during the Israeli military’s crackdown following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel.

ByEric Schmitt,Julian E. Barnes,Helene CooperandDavid E. Sanger Eric Schmitt, Julian E. Barnes, Helene Cooper and David E. Sanger have written extensively about Middle East wars and tensions between the United States and Iran. American, Israeli and Lebanese officials insist that few parties want Israel’s war in Gaza to become a wider conflict that engulfs the Middle East. But theassassinationof a top leader of Hamas in Lebanon on Tuesday, and the deaths of scores of people in mysterious twinexplosions in Iranon Wednesday, threatened to bring the Middle East — and the United States — closer to the brink of a regional war, which the Biden administration has tried to stave off since Hamas’s deadly attacks against Israel on Oct. 7. Just hours after the bombs went off in Iran, the United States and 12 of its allies issued a written warning to another militia group in the region, the Houthis of Yemen, who have been mounting near-daily missile, drone and seaborne attacks on commercial vessels. So far the United States has held back from retaliating againstHouthi basesin Yemen, in large part because it does not want to undermine a fragile truce in Yemen’s civil war. But now Biden officials are signaling that their patience is running out. “Let our message now be clear: We call for the immediate end of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews,” White House officials said in a statement issued on Wednesday, a day after the shipping giant Maersk announced it wouldpause operations in the Red Sea. “The Houthis,” the statement continued, “will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The group has rebuilt after the assassination of other leaders, though. ByBen Hubbard Ben Hubbard has covered the Middle East for more than a decade. Thekilling of Saleh al-Arouri, a top Hamas leader, on Tuesday deprives the group ofone of its most skilled tacticians, who helped route money and weapons to its operatives in the Gaza Strip and elsewhere in the Middle East and integrated Hamas more tightly intoIran’s network of forcescommitted to fighting Israel, according to analysts. But it was far from clear on Wednesday that his death would be a debilitating blow to the organization, which has rebuilt again and again after assassinations of its leaders, and remained agile enough to plot the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in southern Israel. Still, Mr. al-Arouri’s killing — in an explosion in a Beirut suburb that senior officials from Hamas, Lebanon and the United States ascribed to Israel — sets Hamas back at a highly vulnerable time, analysts say. Israel has not taken responsibility for his killing. Israel’s overwhelming offensive in Gaza has significantly weakened the military strength of Hamas there, including its ability to manufacture rockets and other weapons. Mr. al-Arouri’s position, as Hamas’s de facto ambassador to Iran and Hezbollah, meant that he would have had an important role in the group’s efforts to rebuild militarily with help from foreign backers. “Hamas will suffer, because it has lost one of its key strategists,” said Emile Hokayem, the director for regional security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. “He was someone who did well managing high-level political relationships and also had credibility as a commander.” Rebuilding its military capabilities “is going to be the problem for Hamas in the next phase, and it will likely be more dependent on foreign support as its base in Palestine weakens,” Mr. Hokayem added.

"Hamas Used Gaza Hospital as a Command Center, U.S. Intelligence Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/us/politics/gaza-hospital-hamas.html,2024-01-02T23:50:48+0000,"Israeli forces stormed the site in November, drawing intense international scrutiny and criticism.","U.S. spy agencies believe that Hamas and another Palestinian group fighting Israel used Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza to command forces and hold some hostages, according to new American intelligence declassified on Tuesday.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by Israeli forces stormed the site in November, drawing intense international scrutiny and criticism. ByJulian E. Barnes Reporting from Washington U.S. spy agencies believe that Hamas and another Palestinian group fighting Israel usedAl-Shifa Hospital in Gazato command forces and hold some hostages, according to new American intelligence declassified on Tuesday. The hospital was the focus ofa large Israel Defense Forces effort in Novemberto take control of the facility, an operation that came under intense international scrutiny and criticism. Israeli officials said Hamas had built a vast complex under the hospital, making it a legitimate military target. But critics said the military operation effectivelycut off and shut downa crucial part of Gaza’s medical network with little evidence that Hamas was using the hospital as a command post. A senior U.S. intelligence official said on Tuesday that the American government continued to believe that Hamas used the hospital complex and sites beneath it to exercise command and control activities, store weapons and hold “at least a few hostages.” American intelligence agencies obtained information that Hamas fighters had evacuated the complex days before the multiday operation, destroying documents and electronics as they left, the senior intelligence official said. After the operation, the Israeli militarytook reporters to a shaft at the complex leading to a tunnel network. Later, the military showed the tunnels underneath the hospital. White House officials at the time backed the Israeli assessment. “We have information that confirms that Hamas is using that particular hospital for a command and control node,” John F. Kirby, a National Security Council spokesman, said on Nov. 14. In the weeks since the operation,news organizations have continued to raise questionsabout Hamas’s presence at the hospital. And health and humanitarian organizations have criticized the Israeli operation. A humanitarian team lead by the World Health Organization, which visited Al-Shifa immediately after Israeli forces stormed the hospital,called it a “death zone.” But the American intelligence assessment has remained firm that the hospital was used by Hamas. The new intelligence represents the most current American assessment, officials said. The complex was used by both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad to command forces fighting against Israel, according to the intelligence. While the spy agencies provided no visual evidence, a U.S. official said they were confident in their assessment because it was based on information collected by Israel and America’s own intelligence, gathered independently. Some had hoped that the operation to take the hospital could result in the rescue of some of the hostages taken by Palestinian fighters during their Oct. 7 attack on Israel. No hostages were rescued, but Israeli officials found the bodies of two hostages at or near the complex, officials have said. The new American intelligence assessment says the Israeli assessment was at least partially correct that some hostages were held at or under the complex. But those hostages appear to have been moved as Hamas evacuated. Julian E. Barnescovers the U.S. intelligence agencies and international security matters for The Times.

ByAnushka Patil Theprominent Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimiand more than two dozen other women and children were released from Israeli prisons early Thursday, Israeli and Palestinian authorities said, in the latest exchange for hostages held in Gaza. The Israeli military arrested Ms. Tamimi, 22, in a predawn raid on Nov. 6 on suspicion of inciting violence and calling for terrorist activity, but did not bring charges against her for the nearly three weeks she was jailed in the Damon Prison, near Haifa, Israel. According to her lawyer, Mahmoud Hassan, Ms. Tamimi was beaten during her arrest and after she was transferred, in violation of international law, to the prison in Israel from the occupied West Bank. The military had moved on Sunday to keep Ms. Tamimi imprisoned under administrative detention, which would have allowed it to hold her indefinitely without charge or trial. But her name later appeared on the Israeli government’s list of Palestinian prisoners and detainees approved for potential release in the hostage exchange. Her father, the longtime protest leader Bassem Tamimi, is also imprisoned without charge. Ms. Tamimi’s mother, Nariman Tamimi, said on Tuesday that her joy over the prospect of her daughter's release was tempered by repeated threats of violence made against the family by Israeli settlers and by Israel’s security forces, who have banned any celebrations andfired tear gasto disperse crowds of Palestinians waiting to reunite with their loved ones and neighbors. Thesheer number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forcessince the start of the war has also left an indelible mark, Nariman Tamimi said.

BySteven Erlanger Thedecision by the Israeli Supreme Courtto reject legislative control over the judiciary ends for now the languishing effort by the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu to diminish the courts, which had already sparked nine months of protests that only ended when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. The protests had deeply divided Israel, but the subsequent war united it, with even pilots and reservists who had vowed to ignore military exercisesimmediately showing up to fightbefore they were called. If the court’s decision on Monday ripped off this wartime poultice, displaying anew the cultural war at the heart of Israeli politics, Mr. Netanyahu and his government responded by appealing again to wartime unity to try to downplay their loss. It was another version of Mr. Netanyahu’s argument against just about every critic of his performance and his policies — that these are all subjects to be discussed “after the war.” And the ruling of the court, however important, is expected to have little or no impact on the conduct of the war itself. “I don’t think the ruling will change anything,” said Amit Segal, a political columnist for the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth who reported a leak of the ruling and is considered close to Mr. Netanyahu. Even before the war, he said, “Netanyahu did not have enough artillery, so to speak, to overwhelm the opponents.” So it helps him that this ruling has arrived during war, Mr. Segal said, because “he can justify a lack of reaction, and after the war he will have more pressing matters,” like his own political survival.

Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority — which Washington and others have floated as a potential governing body for post-war Gaza — called the United States “aggressive and unethical” and said the veto was “a mark of shame that will follow the United States for many years.” AlthoughBiden officials have saidthat Israel must do more to limit civilian casualties and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, frustration has grown among some U.S. allies as Washington continues to stand behind Israel despite a rising civilian death toll and increasing desperation as aid remains insufficient. Officials across the Middle East have been urging an immediate stop to Israel’s offensive, with Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi,calling it a “massacre”at a news conference in Washington on Friday. Hours after the United States blocked the resolution for an immediate cease-fire, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and an Arab delegation said early Saturday that they had discussed efforts to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza during a meeting in Washington. Mr. Blinken saidhe had discussed “our shared goal of establishing a future Palestinian state alongside Israel” during a meeting on Friday with ministers from Arab nations and representatives for the Palestinian Authority.

ByLiam Stack,Gaya GuptaandAbu Bakr Bashir Walaa Zaiter’s four children have been hungry for weeks, but she can barely find them food. They ask for sandwiches, fruit juice and homemade Palestinian dishes like she used to cook before the war began. In a fleeting moment of internet access, she said, she once caught the children huddled around her phone to watch a YouTube video of someone eating French fries. The most they can hope for these days, she said in a recent telephone interview, is a can of peas, some cheese and an energy bar distributed as a family’s rations by the United Nations once a week in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where they fled to in early December to escape Israeli bombardment farther north. It is not nearly enough to feed her family of seven. “It’s a daily struggle,” said Ms. Zaiter, 37, whose children range in age from 9 months to 13 years. “You feel you are under pressure and hopeless, and you cannot provide anything.” Israel’s war in Gaza has created a humanitarian catastrophe, with half of the population of about 2.2 million at risk of starvation and 90 percent saying that they regularly go without food for a whole day,the United Nations said in a recent report. Arif Husain, chief economist at the World Food Program, said the humanitarian disaster in Gaza was among the worst he had ever seen. The territory appears to meet at least the first criteria of a famine, with 20 percent of the population facing an extreme lack of food, he said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

What made them different may have also made them targets: Tahseen Ali Ahmad, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Hisham Awartani are Palestinian Americans, navigating between the peaceful privilege of college life in America and the dangerous instability of their conflict-ravaged homeland some 5,000 miles away. In an instant, one of the injured students said on Wednesday, those two worlds collapsed into one, shaking his sense of the United States as safer. In his first interview since the shooting, a day after he was discharged from the hospital, Mr. Abdalhamid said that he expects the attack to have a lasting impact — not only for him and his friends, but for every Palestinian. “In the West Bank, we’re not safe because of the occupation, and as a Palestinian American, I’m not safe in America because of people like this that might come out,” he said. “It’s just something that’s very hard to grapple with.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByPeter Baker,Edward Wong,Julian E. BarnesandIsabel Kershner Reporting from Washington and Jerusalem and in some cases traveling with President Biden and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken to the region. President Biden was getting ready to leave the White House for an audacious flight to Israel to demonstrate solidarity after theOct. 7 terrorist attackwhen suddenly the trip seemed to be falling apart before it even began. Anexplosion at a Gaza hospitalhad reportedly killed or wounded hundreds, the Palestinians were blaming Israel, and Arab leaders were refusing to meet with Mr. Biden when he arrived in the region. The president summoned advisers to the Treaty Room on the second floor of the White House family quarters to answer the question: Should he still go? A robust debate broke out between his national security and political advisers. Some in the room urged Mr. Biden to scrap the trip. It was not clear what could be accomplished. It might not even be safe. What if Hamas launched rockets at Ben-Gurion International Airport when Air Force One approached? Where would the president land then? Others argued that he needed to go anyway.He had already announced the visit. They should not lurch from one decision to another. And preliminary U.S. intelligence indicated that Israel was not responsible for the hospital explosion. Finally, Mr. Biden weighed in. “I’ve got to go,” he said. “I’ve got to see these guys face to face.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

He sat at his desk inside Connecticut’s largest refugee resettlement agency, trying to write a public statement about the violence in Israel and Gaza that had resurfaced traumas among his staff, and in his own personal history. “We believe that all human life is precious and should be protected,” he wrote in mid-October. He read over the sentence, and it sounded obvious and weak. He set the draft aside for a few days and then tried again. “We condemn, in the strongest terms, the killing of all innocent civilians,” he wrote, but that phrasing seemed almost clinical — so remote and impersonal compared with how he felt. He had spent several months in the 1970s living and volunteering on Kibbutz Nirim, where dozens of Hamas terrorists broke through the wall on Oct. 7 to kidnap and murder civilians. He had also lived for many years as an American expatriate and a Quaker in Gaza, learning Arabic and working on behalf of oppressed Palestinian children, and now thousands were being killed by Israel’s bombings. And then there were the Israeli hostages still being held captive at the center of the conflict. George understood at least a little about what that was like, too. He was the first American ever kidnapped in Gaza, in 1989, when three Palestinian refugees abducted him and demanded that Israel release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for his life. The extremists held George at gunpoint in a safe house for 29 hours before eventually releasing him unharmed, and then instead of retreating into fear or hatred, George returned to America and devoted his career to helping refugees start new lives and heal from conflict.

ByTalya Minsberg Talya Minsberg visited Hand in Hand schools in Jerusalem and in Haifa, speaking with dozens of teachers, students and parents. In a classroom decorated with Hebrew and Arabic letters, a group of third graders — their eyes closed, their hands placed facing up on their laps — took a deep breath in unison. “And exhale,” a teacher told them. The students, a mix of Jews and Arabs, attend Max Rayne Hand in Hand School in Jerusalem, one of six such bilingual institutions in Israel dedicated to the proposition that Israelis and Palestinians can learn and live together in peace. On a recent day this month, soon after a temporary cease-fire in Gaza collapsed and the prospect for peace seemed more distant than ever, the students were meditating. If regional peace seemed momentarily unobtainable, at least they could try for inner calm. Schools across Israel, most of them divided along lines of religion and language, are struggling with how to help students cope emotionally during the deadliest conflict in a generation. At Hand in Hand schools, where every class has two teachers — a Hebrew speaker and an Arabic speaker — the conversation about the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks and the subsequent war unfolding in Gaza sounds markedly different than in other schools. “We might have different languages, religions and cultures, but we choose to be here together,” Haya Saleh, a Palestinian citizen of Israel and the third graders’ Arabic-speaking teacher, said to her students. As suspicions between Israelis and Palestinians are at an all-time high and support for a peace deal is at its lowest point in decades, the faculty and families who make up the Hand in Hand schools are doing the difficult work of trying to overcome those differences. And they believe they have created a model of honoring one another’s traumas, experiences and histories that can be replicated across the region. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But humanitarian groups say more is urgently needed, with severe hunger gripping the territory and experts warning of famine. Nearly seven months into the war, which was set off by the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel, the humanitarian crisis has not abated. More than a million Gazans have crowded into shelters and tents in the southern city of Rafah, which Israel seems poised to invade.Mass gravesfound at a hospital in southern Gaza underscored the war’s toll on the population and the Gazan medical system, which isnear collapse. A glimmer of hope for a new cease-fire came from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where diplomats said Israel had softened its negotiating stance. But Hamas insists that any truce be permanent, and there was concern that talks could be disrupted if the International Criminal Courtissued arrest warrantsfor Israeli or Hamas leaders, as some officials expect.

ByRaja Abdulrahim,Roni Caryn RabinandThomas Fuller Israeli forces clashed with Hamas militants across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, the Israeli military said, deepening its engagement in the decimated enclave even as the Palestinian death toll from relentless airstrikes in 12 weeks of war soared higher. The Gaza Health Ministry reported Saturday that 165 people had been killed in Israeli airstrikes and artillery attacks in the previous 24 hours, adding to the toll of more than 20,000 people killed in Gaza since the war began with the Oct. 7 Hamas-led raids into Israel. The Israeli military said late Friday that it had destroyed a Gaza City apartment of the person it considers the mastermind of those attacks, Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who sitsatop the list of the Israel military’s most-wanted listin Gaza. The army said Mr. Sinwar used the apartment as a hide-out and that it destroyed a tunnel shaft discovered by its troops in the apartment’s basement floor, as well as an underground headquarters that served as a nerve center for senior officials from Hamas’s military and political wings. He was not believed to be in the complex when it was hit, having decamped to the south when the Israeli campaign began. As global outrage and impatience grows with the war’s devastating human toll, the Biden administration said late Friday that it was bypassing Congress for the second time since the war started for a weapons sale to Israel.

ByEmma Bubola,Amanda HolpuchandRebecca Carballo The police in Burlington, Vt., have arrested a suspect in the shooting of three students of Palestinian descent that the city’s mayor said was being investigated as a possible hate crime. The suspect, identified by the police as Jason J. Eaton, 48, was expected to be arraigned Monday in connection with the shooting of the students, three men in their 20s who attend American universities. They were shot and wounded on Saturday by a white man with a handgun while they were walking near the University of Vermont, the police said. Two of the victims were wearing Palestinian kaffiyehs, a traditional headdress. The young men told family members they were speaking a hybrid of English and Arabic before the man shot at them four times without saying anything before the attack, according to a family spokeswoman. Two of the victims were in stable condition, the authorities said. The third sustained much more serious injuries. In a statement after the arrest, the police said authorities had conducted a search of Mr. Eaton’s residence, adding that the shooting occurred in front of his apartment building. No other details were available, but earlier on Sunday, the chief of the Burlington police, Jon Murad, said that, “In this charged moment, no one can look at this incident and not suspect that it may have been a hate-motivated crime.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The military has moved to keep her jailed without charge, though she could also be freed in a hostage swap. ByAnushka Patil It was around 4 a.m. when Nariman Tamimi’s daughter, Ahed, roused her from sleep and told her that Israeli soldiers had surrounded their home in the occupied West Bank. Nariman Tamimi had been expecting the raid: Over the previous week, an online campaign had vilified her daughter as a terrorist and demanded Ahed’s arrest. But the expectation did little to dull her terror on Nov. 6, when more than a dozen soldiers ransacked their home and hauled Ahed away in handcuffs. Ahed Tamimi, 22, is one of the highest-profile Palestinians arrested by Israel since Oct. 7, as it has conducted a sweeping campaign of raids and detentions that it says is aimed at deterring terrorist attacks but has also prompted alarm from international human rights groups. On Sunday, after holding Ms. Tamimi for nearly three weeks without access to a lawyer or her family, Israel moved to incarcerate her under administrative detention, according to her lawyer, Mahmoud Hassan. She now faces indefinite imprisonment, without charges or trial, based on evidence that neither she nor her lawyer are allowed to view. Israel’s expansive use of administrative detention has been widely criticized as a violation of international law. The detentions, which Israel maintains are a preventative and necessary security measure, are typically upheld by the Israeli military court system and can be renewed indefinitely. The use of administrative detentions had hit a30-year higheven before the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, human rights groups say. “I’m hopeless to defend her,” Mr. Hassan said. Hours after Ms. Tamimi’s hearing, her name appeared on an Israeli government list of Palestinian prisoners and detainees who could be released as part of a hostage exchange with Hamas. The news brought little comfort to Nariman Tamimi, who said the Israeli military’s ban on celebrations and threats to arrest her other children had made her unwilling to speak publicly.

South Africa has been one of the most vocal critics of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. In early November,it recalled all of its diplomats from Israelover that country’s treatment of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Allegations of war crimesby both Israel and by Palestinian militant groups in territories occupied by Israel in 1967 are already under investigation at the International Criminal Court, which is independent of the U.N. But the impact of that investigation is unclear because Israel is not a member nation of the I.C.C. and does not recognize its jurisdiction. Israel is, however, a signatory of the Genocide Convention, along with South Africa, which paved the way for the case at the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has compared Israel’s treatment of Palestinians to apartheid, the racist system of segregation that governed South Africans for nearly 50 years before it ended in 1994. In recalling South Africa’s diplomats from Israel, Mr. Ramaphosa, a former anti-apartheid activist, said the world had “sat helplessly and watched as intensifying airstrikes on Gaza and the West Bank have destroyed schools, health facilities, ambulances and civilian infrastructure and supposedly safe roads traveling to the south of Gaza.” More than 20,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, according to Gazan health authorities. A Hamas-led attack on Israel that day left an estimated 1,200 people dead, Israeli officials say. In its statement on Friday, the Israeli government said it has tried to limit the impact of the war on civilians, and accused South Africa of cooperating with Hamas, “a terrorist organization that is calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.” TheWorld Court, based in The Hague, is tasked with settling legal disputes between member nations.

ByYara Bayoumy reporting from Jerusalem Two children were shot dead by Israeli soldiers during a raid in the city of Jenin in the northern West Bank, on Wednesday, the Palestinian health ministry and a local official said. The Palestinian Authority’s news agency, Wafa, said the two were Adam al-Ghoul, 8, and Basil Abu al-Wafa, 15. Mohammed Sabbagh, the head of a leadership council in Jenin, said two members of armed groups were also killed during a raid by Israeli forces that began Tuesday night. Mr. Sabbagh said Israeli forces had surrounded the gunmen’s homes before they were killed. He added that Israeli forces had been searching homes in some parts of the area raided. That area, known as the Jenin refugee camp, was established in 1953 to house Palestinians displaced in the founding of Israel, and has become an urban environmentknown for fierce opposition to Israel. Asked to comment on the raid, the Israeli military said “a number of suspects hurled explosive devices” toward its soldiers. “The soldiers responded with live fire toward the suspects and hits were identified,” it added. Wafa said that Israeli forces had also made a number of arrests at the camp, and that the Israeli forces’ bulldozers had demolished some infrastructure, including water, electricity and sewage networks. Israeli forces also killed seven Palestinians, including two minors and at least one gunman, in the occupied West Bank over the weekend, Reutersreported. The Israeli military said in a statement at the time that “five terrorists have been eliminated” and that it had detained 21 people. Tensions have risen in the West Bank since Hamas launched terrorist attacks from Gaza, the Palestinian territory it controls, on Oct. 7, in which 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel and roughly 240 were taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. Israel retaliated with bombardments and a ground invasion in Gaza, and more than 13,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gazan health authorities. Since Oct. 7, Israeli security forces have carried out daily raids in the occupied West Bank and increased restrictions on Palestinian residents in some areas of the territory. Violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers in the West Bank has also reached record highs, according to the United Nations. Israeli forces have arrested hundreds of Palestinians, according to Palestinian and Israeli accounts. Hiba Yazbekcontributed reporting from Jerusalem, andJohnatan Reissfrom Tel Aviv.

Where Was the Israeli Military?,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/30/world/middleeast/israeli-military-hamas-failures.html,2023-12-30T05:01:43+0000,A Times investigation found that troops were disorganized and out of position and relied on social media to choose targets. Behind the failure: Israel had no battle plan for a massive Hamas invasion.,"Far beneath the Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, in a bunker known as The Pit, commanders were trying to make sense of reports of Hamas rocket fire in southern Israel early on the morning of Oct. 7, when the call came in.","On Oct. 7, Hamas terrorists made attacking Israel look easy.Warning:This article has videos containing graphic imagery and violence. They breached Israel’s borders at over 30 locations, disabled robotic machine guns, took control of major roadways, brazenly attacked military bases and invaded neighborhoods. Gunmen killed and kidnapped hundreds of people unimpeded for hours. Again and again, one thing is missing from the picture: the Israeli army. Supported by Far beneath the Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, in a bunker known as The Pit, commanders were trying to make sense of reports of Hamas rocket fire in southern Israel early on the morning of Oct. 7, when the call came in. It was a commander from the division that oversees military operations along the border with Gaza. Their base was under attack. The commander could not describe the scope of the attack or provide more details, according to a military official with knowledge of the call. But he asked that all available reinforcements be sent. At 7:43 a.m., more than an hour after the rocket assault began and thousands of Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, The Pit issued its first deployment instructions of the day. It ordered all emergency forces to head south, along with all available units that could do so quickly. But the nation’s military leaders did not yet recognize that an invasion of Israel was already well underway. Hours later, desperate Israeli citizens were still fending for themselves and calling for help. Roughly 1,200 people died as the Middle East’s most advanced military failed in its essential mission: protecting Israeli lives. This group of Hamas gunmen has a clear target: a crucial military operations center. Where’s the opening? Ahmad, it’s here. Ahmad, it’s here. OK, go. Come on. Go. Say “God is great.” God is great. Go. Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. They make their way from Gaza to the Re’im army base, killing civilians in their path. There’s someone in the car. There’s someone in the car. There’s someone in the car. Stop right there. Stop right there. Salef, come shoot these. This is the heart of all military operations along the Israel-Gaza border. Give it to me for a little bit. “Calm down, man.”“Just for a minute.” I told him to stay in [indistinct]. Someone should come with me. Someone should come with me. As terrorists infiltrate the base, the soldiers are unable to coordinate a response across the region. In this room?  Go in. Go in. Go forward. Go forward. Throw a grenade. Throw a grenade. Give me a grenade. Only a few roads connect the towns of southern Israel. Gunmen roam freely along these roadways, including Route 232 and Route 242, on the day of the attack. To heaven, to heaven. [Indistinct name] will take it. To heaven. To heaven. To heaven [indistinct] Our jeeps are there. Our jeeps are there. Abu Ahmad. Abu Ahmad. Our jeeps are there. Abu Ahmad, our jeeps are there. They’re descending. Hamas gunmen terrorize motorists, opening fire on passing vehicles, and gather at major intersections, sowing chaos and taking control of main traffic arteries. The mayhem on the roads impedes a faster response by the military, and hours will pass before it establishes control of the routes. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByEileen Sullivan,Edward WongandPatrick Kingsley Eileen Sullivan and Edward Wong reported from Washington, and Patrick Kingsley from Jerusalem. Follow live news updates on theIsrael-Hamas war. Israel is preventing Palestinian Americans from entering the country from the West Bank, an apparent violation of arecent agreementin which citizens from the United States and Israel can travel to the other nation without a visa. The Homeland Security and State Departments, which manage the program, said American officials were trying to resolve the issue. “U.S. government officials are working with the government of Israel to address reports of Americans facing issues in traveling to and flying out of Ben-Gurion Airport,” said Erin Heeter, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security. The arrangement, announced in late September, before the war began, was part of a larger effort toward improving relations between the two countries. At the time, President Biden was making a push to broker a diplomatic deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Under the visa waiver program, Israel would lift restrictions on Palestinian Americans and other Americans of Arab or Muslim descent, easing the way for them to travel to and from Palestinian territories. For decades, Palestinian Americans have faced difficulties traveling to the Israeli-occupied West Bank to see family and friends or to do humanitarian work. They have been forced to first travel to Jordan, which shares a border with the territory. They typically fly in and out of the Queen Alia International Airport in Amman, the capital of Jordan, rather than entering or leaving from Tel Aviv.

ByAaron Boxerman,Isabel KershnerandThomas Fuller Aaron Boxerman and Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and Thomas Fuller from San Francisco. The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had caused “unintended harm” to “uninvolved civilians” in two strikes this week on a densely packed Gaza Strip neighborhood, where, the local health authorities said, dozens were killed. It was a rare admission of fault by the military over its conduct of the war. The military said it was targeting Hamas on Sunday when it launched two strikes on the central Gazan community of Al Maghazi, which has been flooded with Palestinians uprooted by war and crammed into homes by the dozen. “A preliminary investigation revealed that additional buildings located near the targets were also hit during the strikes, which likely caused unintended harm to additional uninvolved civilians,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. “The I.D.F. regrets the harm to uninvolved individuals, and is working to draw lessons from the incident,” the statement said. Israel has come under growing international pressure to scale back its heavy air and ground campaign in Gaza, where more than 20,000 people have been reported killed, after a Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Much of the criticism has been not just about the extent of the bombing, but also about the weapons being used, includingU.S.-provided 2,000-pound bombsthat many military experts say are unsuitable for densely populated areas. After thestrike in Al Maghazi, photos showed a gray concrete building gaping with dark holes where rooms used to be, and a mound of debris where men appeared to be digging for survivors, or bodies.

Then, the campus and its president receded from attention — for now. BySharon Otterman In the weeks after Oct. 7, Columbia University was the scene of rising tensions over the Israel-Hamas war on American college campuses. A Jewish student said he wasassaultedafter putting up posters of hostages. Pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian students accused one another of support for genocide in a series of heatedprotests and counter-protests. But as the fall semester ended, Columbia faded from the spotlight even as its peer schools, Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania in particular, were scrutinized over their responses to the war and claims of antisemitism on campus. Supporters of Columbia’s president, Nemat Shafik, credit her diplomatic skills in avoiding a similar public relations crisis. But detractors said she has bent too far to the demands of Israel supporters, angering students and some faculty members but keeping powerful donors and trustees mostly happy. She might also have benefited from a bit of luck. When Congress invited her to acongressional hearing on antisemitismon Dec. 5 with her peers from Harvard, Penn and M.I.T., Dr. Shafik said she could not go. She told representatives that she had already planned to attend theCOP28 climate conferencein Dubai, where sheintroduced a panel about women leaders. The Congressional hearing did not go well. The University of Pennsylvania president lost her job and the Harvard president became mired in weeks of controversy. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The author Nathan Thrall said no thank you. ByVimal Patel A few weeks ago, Nathan Thrall, a Jewish American writer whose work strongly supports Palestinian rights, was invited to speak to students at the University of Arkansas about a new book. But there was one catch: To be paid for his visit, Mr. Thrall was told that he had to pledge, according to a 2017 state law, that he would not boycott Israel. He declined. When news broke that Mr. Thrall would not sign the pledge, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders applauded the university. “On campuses across America, pro-Hamas protesters are harassing Jews, praising terrorism, and calling for the destruction of Israel,” Ms. Sanders, a Republican, wrote on social media. “That is unacceptable and won’t happen in Arkansas.” At college campuses around the country, students and faculty have been engulfed in vitriolic debates over students’ pro-Palestinian speech. There have been loud dueling protests and angry donors registering their displeasure on social media. Brandeis,Columbiaand George Washington University have banned or suspended pro-Palestinian student protest groups. At a large public university in a more conservative state like Arkansas, the debate is playing out in a somewhat different way. Well before the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, state lawmakers had tried to control the debate on the Middle East, for instance demanding in the 2017 law that anyone contracting with the state sign a pledge against boycotting Israel.

One problem: local officials have little power. ByShawn HublerandHeather Knight Shawn Hubler reported from Sacramento, and Heather Knight from San Francisco. In Seattle, the debate consumed much of two City Council meetings. In San Francisco, the line to speak stretched long all night under the City Hall dome. The Oakland City Council spent four hours just on public comment. For weeks, Americans in a host of Democratic-led cities have packed their government chambers for marathon sessions, all to demand immediate action from local leaders on a matter nowhere near home: the Israel-Hamas war. More than a dozen U.S. city councils have now passed resolutions urging Israel to stop shelling Gaza, including several in Michigan, which has a sizable Muslim population, and several in California. Among the biggest cities to do so are Atlanta and Detroit. As the death toll in the Israel-Hamas war has mounted and bombing has killed more than 15,500 people according to Gaza health officials, disagreements have roiled communities large and small. Early support for Israel following the Oct. 7 slaughter of some 1,200 Israelis by Hamas has been met with calls to help Palestinians. Local resolutions on international affairs largely amount to symbolic gestures that play no direct role in foreign policymaking. But they can send a signal to allies abroad over the domestic political temperature and provide a vehicle for some of the most opinionated voters to say their piece. Those calling for cease-fire resolutions believe that this time, a critical mass of local gestures may ultimately convey to the White House that it has lost support for backing Israel’s military campaign. Especially if the resolutions come from Democratic strongholds that serve as President Biden’s base. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Supported by ByJeffrey Gettleman,Anat SchwartzandAdam Sella Photographs byAvishag Shaar-Yashuv Jeffrey Gettleman, Anat Schwartz and Adam Sella reported from across Israel and interviewed more than 150 people. At first, she was known simply as “the woman in the black dress.” In a grainy video, you can see her, lying on her back, dress torn, legs spread, vagina exposed. Her face is burned beyond recognition and her right hand covers her eyes. The video was shot in the early hours of Oct. 8 by a woman searching for a missing friend at the site of the rave in southern Israel where, the day before, Hamas terroristsmassacred hundreds of young Israelis. The video went viral, with thousands of people responding, desperate to know if the woman in the black dress was their missing friend, sister or daughter. One family knew exactly who she was — Gal Abdush, mother of two from a working-class town in central Israel, who disappeared from the rave that night with her husband. As the terrorists closed in on her, trapped on a highway in a line of cars of people trying to flee the party, she sent one final WhatsApp message to her family: “You don’t understand.” Based largely on the video evidence — which was verified by The New York Times — Israeli police officials said they believed that Ms. Abdush was raped, and she has become a symbol of the horrors visited upon Israeli women and girls during the Oct. 7 attacks.

ByNadav GavrielovandThomas Fuller As Israel pounded targets in the Gaza Strip from the air and sea on Wednesday, a member of the country’s war cabinet threatened action on a second front, along the border with Lebanon, where the Iranian-backed militia Hezbollah has fired rocket barrages into Israel. “I say to our friends around the world: The situation in the northern border necessitates change,” the war cabinet member, Benny Gantz, told reporters. “The time for a diplomatic solution is running out. If the world and the government of Lebanon don’t act to stop the fire toward northern communities and to push Hezbollah away from the border, the I.D.F. will do that.” The reference was to the Israel Defense Forces. The threat of a wider war has preoccupied the United States and its allies since the start of the conflict in Gaza, and has only grown as three Iranian-backed groups — Hamas, Hezbollah andHouthis in Yemen— launch attacks toward Israel as well as on commercial ships in the Red Sea. The concern prompted the United States todispatch two aircraft carriersto the Eastern Mediterranean in the weeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. The Israeli military said Wednesday that its northern command, along the border with Lebanon, was in a “state of very high readiness.” The military’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said, “We need to be prepared to strike if required.” Tensions rose even higher this week after Iran accused Israel ofkilling Brig. Gen. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, a senior adviser to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, in a missile strike in Syria. On Wednesday, a cortège of mourners accompanied his body through the Iraqi cities of Najaf and Karbala, and a representative of the Revolutionary Guard, Ramezan Sharif, again threatened retaliation against Israel, The Associated Press reported.

Ms. Abed, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, said the situation felt so toxic that they feared their 10-day trip to talk about the ways Palestinians and Jews can work together would only lead to attacks from all sides. Instead, in New York, Washington and Boston, they found packed auditoriums and eager audiences in community centers, synagogues, libraries and the offices of politicians like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Their days have started at 6 a.m. and ended after midnight. Their quest can be lonely, standing in the face of intense grief and anger — over Hamas’s attacks against Israelis on Oct. 7, and Israel’s retaliatory campaign in the Gaza Strip — and factions that have spent decades staking out positions against each other. But the staff of their organization, Standing Together, is trying to teach Americans — anyone who will listen, really — abouttheir lived realityand the only path they see moving forward. They describe that path as one that cannot be boiled down to a hashtag: one in which millions of Israelis and Palestinians would remain on the land they each call home, and one that would require enough popular political will to demand peace.

U.S. to Deny Visas to Violent Israeli Settlers and Some West Bank Palestinians,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/us/politics/us-visas-israelis-palestinians.html,2023-12-05T17:48:23+0000,"As acts of violence spike in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, American officials say they will take action against people “believed to have been involved in undermining peace.”","The Biden administration is imposing visa bans on dozens of Israeli settlers who have committed acts of violence in the West Bank, taking action against what U.S. officials call a potential trigger for wider violence as Israel wages war in Gaza.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement As acts of violence spike in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, American officials say they will take action against people “believed to have been involved in undermining peace.” ByMichael Crowley Reporting from Washington The Biden administration is imposing visa bans on dozens of Israeli settlers who have committed acts of violence in the West Bank, taking action against what U.S. officials call a potential trigger for wider violence as Israel wages war in Gaza. In a statement on Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken announced a new policy “targeting individuals believed to have been involved in undermining peace, security or stability in the West Bank, including through committing acts of violence or taking other actions that unduly restrict civilians’ access to essential services and basic necessities.” U.S. officials are most concerned about arecent surge in attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians, but the new policy will also deny entry to Palestinians who have committed violent acts against Israelis. Under State Department privacy rules, the names of the people who will be designated in the coming days will not be made public. The restrictions may also be extended to their immediate family members, Mr. Blinken said. The move comes as the United States tries to revive efforts to achieve a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after the current Gaza conflict is over, in the hopes of breaking the cycle of violence between the two sides. Any two-state solution would require Israel’s government to rein in right-wing West Bank settlers, who oppose the creation of a Palestinian state. Extremist settler violence has spiked recently, and Palestinians and many analysts say that Israel’s government has allowed the often heavily armed settlers to operate with impunity. Attacks on Palestinians, meant to drive them from their homes, had reached theirhighest recorded levelseven before the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks — and have only accelerated since then. “Instability in the West Bank both harms the Israeli and Palestinian people and threatens Israel’s national security interests,” Mr. Blinken said in his statement.

ByChristoph Koettl The Israeli military crossed into central Gaza between Dec. 24 and 26, new satellite images obtained and analyzed by The New York Times showed, giving a fuller picture of the latest front in Israel’s war to eradicate Hamas from the embattled enclave. By Tuesday, Israeli forces had reached the outskirts of Al Bureij, a densely built-up neighborhood in the center of the Gaza Strip, about one mile from the border with Israel. In a news briefing on Tuesday, the military confirmed the advance, saying that its forces had targeted terrorist infrastructure in the area of Al Bureij and had found a tunnel shaft. “We are expanding the fighting to the area called the central camps,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the military, said. The military crossed the border in at least two locations to advance toward Al Bureij. The imagery, obtained from the commercial image provider Planet Labs, captured dozens of armored vehicles, as well as freshly cleared areas and earthen fortifications. Al Bureij was founded decades ago as a refugee camp for Palestinians displaced in the creation of Israel, and has grown into a small but densely packed neighborhood,according to UNRWA, the U.N. agency aiding Palestinian refugees. On Sunday, airstrikes in and around the neighborhood left dozens dead, Gazan health ministry officials said. Satellite imagery also revealed newly destroyed residential and other buildings that were hit. Avideopublished by the Israeli military and verified by The Times shows some of the same armored vehicles shortly after they crossed the border, moving deeper into Gaza. At the end of last week, Israel told residents of the same area in central Gaza, which was home toalmost 90,000 peoplebefore the war, to evacuate south. The orders and new military advance impact an area thathad not been previously been a focus of Israel’s offensive.

A number of other Palestinians detained under similar circumstances remain in custody. ByRaja Abdulrahim A celebrated Palestinian poet and essayist who founded the Gaza Strip’s first English-language library was released by Israel on Tuesday, two days after he was detained as his family was fleeing to southern Gaza on foot. The poet, Mosab Abu Toha, was taken to a detention center in the Negev desert in southern Israel, said Diana Buttu, a family friend who spoke to him soon after he was released in Gaza at the same spot where he was first detained. She said he was likely freed because of public pressure, including from publications like The New Yorker magazine, which Mr. Abu Toha has contributed to, and the free speech organization PEN America. “He was interrogated and he was actually beaten,” Ms. Buttu said. “They hit him in the stomach. They hit him in the face several times.” The Israeli military confirmed that he was among several civilians taken in for questioning and he was then released. It did not immediately comment on the allegations that he had been beaten. Dozens of other families who have arrived in central and southern Gaza have reported that their sons, husbands and fathers, who they said had no connection to armed Palestinian groups, have vanished after being stopped by Israel’s military along the evacuation route for those fleeing northern Gaza. The Israeli military said it had apprehended 300 people during the ground invasion that began more than three weeks ago and said that they were connected to armed groups, adding that they “were brought into Israeli territory for further interrogations.” Those interrogations had led Israeli forces to the locations of underground tunnels, warehouses and weapons in Gaza, according to the military.

ByPatrick Kingsley To gauge the Israeli mood, Patrick Kingsley spoke to Israelis from different political, religious and ethnic backgrounds in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak, Eli and Tekoa. The Oct. 7 attack on Israel has prompted soul-searching onthe Israeli left, undermining faith in a shared future with Palestinians. It has created acrisis of confidenceon the Israeli right,sapping supportfor Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It has drawn ultra-Orthodox Jews, often ambivalent about their relationship to the Israeli state, closer to the mainstream. Across religious and political divides, Israelis are coming to terms with what the Hamas-led terrorist attack meant for Israel as a state, for Israelis as a society, and for its citizens as individuals. Just as Israel’s failures in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war ultimately upended its political and cultural life, the Oct. 7 assault and its aftershocks are expected to reshape Israel for years to come. The attack, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, has collapsed Israelis’ sense of security and shaken their trust in Israel’s leaders. It has shattered the idea that Israel’s blockade of Gaza and occupation of the West Bank could continue indefinitely without significant fallout for Israelis. And for Israel’s Jewish majority, it has broken the country’s central promise. When Israel was founded in 1948, the defining goal was to provide a sanctuary for Jews, after 2,000 years of statelessness and persecution. On Oct. 7, that same state proved unable to prevent the worst day of violence against Jews since the Holocaust. “At that moment, our Israeli identity felt so crushed. It felt like 75 years of sovereignty, of Israeliness, had — in a snap — disappeared,” said Dorit Rabinyan, an Israeli novelist. “We used to be Israelis,” she added. “Now we are Jewish.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByJason Horowitz Reporting from Rome Pope Francis on Monday focused his Christmas address on the violence in Israel andwar in Gaza, which had caused an “appalling” loss of civilian life and brought “sorrow” to Bethlehem, traditionally seen as the birthplace of Jesus, as he called for the release of Israeli hostages and an end to devastating military attacks. Delivering his “Urbi et Orbi” — or “to the city and to the world” — Christmas blessing on the birth of Jesus as a symbol of peace, Francis, who turned 87 last week, spoke from a balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica under gray clouds on an unseasonably warm day in Rome before a crowd of tens of thousands. He pleaded for peace around the world, naming specific conflicts, including in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Sudan and Ukraine, but it was the conflict in Gaza that was foremost in his message. “The eyes and the hearts of Christians throughout the world turnto Bethlehem,” Francis said, calling attention to “deep shadows covering the land.” He pleaded for peace to “come in Israel and Palestine, where war is devastating the lives of those peoples,” and said he embraced “them all, particularly the Christian communities of Gaza, the parish of Gaza and the entire Holy Land.” Francis’ comments served to amplify his message from the Christmas Eve midnight Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica only hours earlier, where he declared that “our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war.” Continuing that theme in the Urbi et Orbi address, he said that his “heart grieves for the victims of the abominable attack”on Oct. 7and reiterated his “urgent appeal for the liberation of those still being held hostage.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Inside its cozy storefront, Palestinian flags flank a glass case filled with grape leaves, fried eggplant and beef pies. It is a place to celebrate Palestinian culture — “something beautiful to share with others,” said Ayat Masoud, who owns the restaurant with her husband. And in one of New York City’s most diverse neighborhoods, where Arabic signs announce businesses, and people of many faiths and ethnicities work, shop and live side-by-side, a sizable portion of Ayat’s customers are Jewish. “I appreciate people coming here to eat good food and find peace,” said Ms. Masoud, who welcomes all. Esther Smith, who is Jewish, stopped in for a quick bite this week with her husband. “It’s kind of ironic that we chose this place,” said Ms. Smith, 47. “It’s a good reminder that we really have to separate the politics from the people.” But the war in Israel is testing the ties that bind Bay Ridge, and setting aside decades of complex and painful politics is not so simple. At Ayat, a mural overlooking the room shows Palestinian children imprisoned underneath the golden dome of the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex in Jerusalem, guarded by Israeli soldiers. After the Hamas attack on Israel onOct. 7, Ayat was suddenly flooded with dozens of one-star reviews online. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Even as Israeli tanks and ground troops continued to battle Hamas militants in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday outlined a postwar vision for the territory, one that he said would not involve the Palestinian Authority in its current form. “We need to see the following two things,” Mr. Netanyahu told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Gaza has to be demilitarized and Gaza has to be de-radicalized,” he said. “And I think so far, we haven’t seen any Palestinian force, including the Palestinian Authority, that is able to do it.” Mr. Netanyahu said “overall military responsibility” would be handled by Israel after the war. The comments were at odds with views expressed by the Biden administration, which last week made it clear that there should be no Israeli “re-occupation” of Gaza. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken left open the possibility of a “transition period” after the war, but said that eventually Gaza’s administration “must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.” The Israeli military released footage over the weekend of tanks rolling past the concrete shells of half-destroyed buildings in Gaza and soldiers scrambling through abandoned homes. The military said five Israeli soldiers were killed on Friday, including four in a blast from a booby-trapped tunnel shaft. More than 360 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 people and triggered the war. The death toll among Gazans has been more than 11,000, according to health authorities in Hamas-controlled Gaza. And 1.58 million Gazans, around three-quarters of the territory’s population, have been displaced, according to estimates by the United Nations. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Now there is a push to revive interest in the craft among younger generations.,"In every stitch, there is a story.","Advertisement Supported by Traditional Palestinian embroidery is on UNESCO’s list of cultural heritage. Now there is a push to revive interest in the craft among younger generations. ByRaja Abdulrahim Reporting from Birzeit, West Bank In every stitch, there is a story. Like layers of history, the hand-stitched Palestinian embroidery known as tatreez, traditionally used to ornament Palestinian dress, tells of towns and villages lost, old customs abandoned, past lives and survival. The stitched designs and symbols once functioned almost as an identification card. The rooster, an old Christian symbol, indicated the wearer’s faith. A red bird on a blue-threaded robe worn by widows meant the woman was ready to remarry. An image of a particular plant or fruit suggested the garment’s origin, like orange blossoms adorning robes from Jaffa or cypress trees on those from Hebron. “Every town’s embroidery has a special characteristic,” said Baha Jubeh, the collections and conservation manager at the Palestinian Museum in Birzeit, as he stood among a long row of these dresses, known as thobes, some dating back decades and others more than a century. “But all of them together combine to create a historical Palestinian identity.” The craft “is a central part of the Palestinian heritage,” he added. In 2021, UNESCO added Palestinian embroidery to its list ofIntangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, recognizing it as “a widespread social and intergenerational practice in Palestine,” a symbol of national pride and a way in which women supplement family income. But like other Indigenous handicrafts across the world, it faces threats, including mechanization and abandonment of old styles of dress. Now there is a push to revive the handicraft in younger generations and to preserve old thobes that tell Palestinian history. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByAdam Entous Reporting from Baghdad, the West Bank and Israel Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, in visits to both the West Bank and Iraq, sought to reassure Palestinian leaders on Sunday that the United States was committed to minimizing harm to civilians under fire in the Gaza Strip from Israel and to warn Iran not to jump into the conflict. Mr. Blinken, who has been in the Middle East since Friday, early in the day held an unannounced meeting in the Israeli-occupied West Bank with thepresident of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. Then, in anothersurprise visit, he traveled to Baghdad, reinforcing a signal to Iran that the United States is prepared to defend its allies in the region against aggression by Iran or its proxies. “It was very important to send a very clear message to anyone who might seek to take advantage of the conflict in Gaza to threaten our personnel here or anywhere else in the region: Don’t do it,” Mr. Blinken said in a brief address at the Baghdad airport. During his visit to the West Bank city of Ramallah earlier in the day, Mr. Blinken spoke to Mr. Abbas about U.S. efforts to get Israeli leaders to “minimize civilian harm” in Gaza, a senior State Department official said. The Health Ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip says more than 9,700 people in the territory have been killed in the Israeli campaign. Mr. Abbas called for “an immediate halt” to the war in Gaza and an end to Israeli attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank, which he described as “no less horrific,” according to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency.

"In Campus Protests Over Gaza, Echoes of Outcry Over Vietnam",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/gaza-vietnam-student-protest.html,2023-12-24T10:01:43+0000,The war in Vietnam ignited a protest movement that helped define a generation. Is the war between Israel and Hamas doing the same thing?,Richard Flacks remembers the challenges of building a protest movement during the Vietnam War as a pillar of the left-wing political and antiwar group Students for a Democratic Society during the 1960s.,"Advertisement Supported by The war in Vietnam ignited a protest movement that helped define a generation. Is the war between Israel and Hamas doing the same thing? ByMichael Wines Richard Flacks remembers the challenges of building a protest movement during the Vietnam War as a pillar of the left-wing political and antiwar groupStudents for a Democratic Societyduring the 1960s. “The whole idea of S.D.S. began with the idea of, ‘We need a new way of being on the left, a new vocabulary, a new strategy,’” said Mr. Flacks, who helped write the group’s manifesto, thePort Huron Statement, in 1962. “We knew we were right, and I don’t think we were arrogant about it.” Sixty years later, Iman Abid sees similar challenges in the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. “For so long, we couldn’t get Palestine to be that issue for people to care about,” said Ms. Abid, the organizing and advocacy director at theU.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, which works with pro-Palestinian campus organizations. “But now people care about it because they’re seeing it. They’re watching it on their social media. They’re watching it on the news.” It is too early to know whether the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will define this generation as opposition to the Vietnam War did for many young people more than a half century ago. But to many who have studied or lived through the Vietnam era, the parallels to the Gaza protests are compelling: a powerful military raining aerial destruction on a small, underdeveloped nonwhite land; a generational divide over the morality of the conflict; a sense that the war represented far broader political and cultural currents; an unswerving confidence — critics might say sanctimony — among students that their cause is righteous. The differences can be glaring, too, beginning with the terrorist attack by Hamas that set this war in motion, for which there is nothing comparable in Vietnam. The Gaza war is not being fought by the American military, unlike Vietnam, where more than 58,000 Americans died and young men faced a military draft.

ByClaire Fahy,Erin NolanandOlivia Bensimon Thousands of people took to the streets on Friday evening in the latest instance of what has become near daily protests in New York City over the Israel-Hamas war. This time, pro-Palestinian demonstrators held banners and signs demanding a cease-fire in the bombardment of Gaza. Earlier in the afternoon, several rallies attracting hundreds of people formed at different points around the city, including Union Square, the J.P. Morgan offices on Madison Avenue and Gov. Kathy Hochul’s New York office near the United Nations headquarters, before merging on the steps of the New York Public Library near Bryant Park. The group then began its march through Midtown Manhattan. As demonstrators wound their way through the center of the city, they waved Palestinian flags, held handmade signs with messages like “Ceasefire now,” and chanted, “Free Palestine.” The crowd stretched several blocks and paused at times in front of Pennsylvania Station and the New York Times building. Debbie Bitar, 69, who marched with a Palestinian flag draped over her shoulders, said she hoped the gatherings would catch the attention of politicians and pressure them to call for a cease-fire and to end the United States’ aid to Israel. “Every day I am watching Palestinian people get massacred,” Ms. Bitar said. “This can’t keep happening.” Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct. 7 killed about 1,200, according to the Israeli authorities, and the death toll in Gaza, according to Gazan health officials, has crossed 11,000. The actress Susan Sarandon has been a regular figure at protests throughout the city in recent weeks and was among the crowd that first gathered at Union Square.

Mangled pipes poured sewer water into what remained of the road. On either side of the runoff were piles of broken pavement, churned up by bulldozers. The archway at the entrance to the neighborhood had been demolished; the gnarled hull of a black car sat nearby. Almost all of the residents of Jenin, a more than 70-year-old refugee camp turned neighborhood in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, had fled in recent weeks. Of the handful who remained, few dared venture out onto the street. They knew that at any moment the quiet could erupt in the paw-paw-paw of gunfire and the hissing hydraulics of bulldozers as Israeli security forces carried out a new raid. Since the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, the Jenin neighborhood — long known as a bastion of armed resistance to the Israeli occupation — has been a focal point of what Israeli officials describe as counterterrorism operations in the West Bank and an extension of their war in Gaza. Across the occupied territory, Israel has conducted near-nightly raids. In Jenin, it has done so every few days, sometimes twice a day, and has arrested at least 158 people, according to the Israeli authorities. Palestinian officials say at least 330 residents have been arrested and 67 people killed, including an 8-year-old child. It is the deadliest two-month stretch Jenin has experienced in recent memory, described by residents as a relentless siege. The local armed resistance has been pummeled — for now, residents say.

Eaton, 48, of Burlington, was charged with shooting three college students of Palestinian descent on Saturday outside the building where the police said he lives. transcript “Today, our office filed charges against Mr. Eaton, specifically three counts of attempted murder for the senseless, unprovoked violence against these three young men. These are three life felonies. And although we do not yet have evidence to support a hate crime enhancement, I do want to be clear that there is no question this was a hateful act.” “My sister lives in the occupied West Bank and people often ask me, ‘Aren’t you worried about your sister? Aren’t you worried about your nephews and your niece?’ And the reality is, as difficult as their life is, they are surrounded by an incredible sense of community. And tragic irony is not even the right phrase. But to have them come stay with me for Thanksgiving and have something like this happen speaks to the level of civic vitriol, speaks to the level of hatred that exists in some corners of this country.” ByJenna RussellandTik Root Reporting from Plymouth, Mass., and Burlington, Vt. A 48-year-old Vermont man was charged on Monday with three counts of attempted second-degree murder in the weekend shooting of three young men of Palestinian descent on a Burlington street, a violent episode that stunned the small city. As investigators sought to determine whether the shooting could be classified as a hate crime, local officials called the attack on the three men — college students who were visiting for Thanksgiving — one of the most shocking events in Burlington’s history, and a grave setback for a city that strives to be welcoming. “Whether or not it was a hate crime by the law, there is no question it was a hateful act,” Chief Jon Murad of the Burlington police said at a news conference on Monday afternoon. The suspect, Jason J. Eaton, pleaded not guilty on Monday and was being held without bail. He appeared in court through a remote video link from jail, and did not speak during the brief hearing except to thank the judge. If convicted, he could face life in prison. The three young men, all 20, had been staying at the home of an uncle of one of them, and had gone out for a walk around 6:30 p.m. Saturday, according to the Burlington police. The police said Mr. Eaton approached the three friends outside the apartment building where he lives on North Prospect Street, and without speaking, pulled out a handgun and started shooting from about two yards away.

Ron DeSantis and Florida education officials violated the First Amendment when they ordered the removal of support for Students for Justice in Palestine, a campus activist group.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by ByVimal Patel The American Civil Liberties Union and Palestine Legal filed a federal lawsuit Thursday claiming that Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida education officials violated the First Amendment when they ordered the removal of support for Students for Justice in Palestine, a campus activist group. The order affected the group’s chapters at the University of Florida and the University of South Florida. The order, which hasn’t been carried out, has already cast a “significant chill” on the activities of the University of Florida’s chapter, “causing its Board and members to think twice before organizing and advocating for Palestine,” the lawsuit stated. The lawsuit also contends that the order by Florida to deactivate its chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine is based on claims about the national organization and not the local chapters. In addition to Governor DeSantis, the lawsuit named as defendants Ray Rodrigues, chancellor of the State University System of Florida; Ben Sasse, the University of Florida’s president; and board members of the system and university. A spokesman for the University of Florida said that it did not comment on pending litigation but in an earlier statement said that the university had not removed any student organizations. Jeremy T. Redfern, a spokesman for Mr. DeSantis, said, “Groups that claim to be part of a foreign terrorist movement have no place on our university campuses.” Two weeks after the Hamas attack in Israel, Mr. Rodrigues, who oversees the state’s 12 public universities, wrote to their presidents that the group’s chapters must be “deactivated,” meaning they could no longer access university space or funding. The decision, which Mr. Rodrigues said was based on consultation with Governor DeSantis, was not based on anything the local chapters said or did but rather on what the letter described as the national organization’s “support of terrorism.” The national group had released a “Day of Resistance” tool kit, describing the Hamas attack as “the resistance” and stating that “Palestinian students in exile are PART of this movement, not in solidarity with this movement.” Mr. Rodrigues’s letter stated that providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations was a felony under Florida law.

‘God Is Under the Rubble in Gaza’: Bethlehem’s Subdued Christmas,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/23/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-bethlehem-christmas.html,2023-12-23T13:12:29+0000,"The war in Gaza has prompted the city, traditionally seen as the birthplace of Jesus, to tone down its Christmas celebrations.","There will be no musical festivities.

ByYara BayoumyandSamar Hazboun Reporting from Bethlehem in the West Bank There will be no musical festivities. No tree-lighting ceremony. No extravagant decorations that normally bedeck the West Bank city of Bethlehem at Christmas. With the war in Gaza raging, this is a city in mourning. In perhaps the most overt display of how Israel’s war in Gaza has dampened Christmas celebrations in the city seen as the birthplace of Jesus, a Lutheran church put up its crèche, but with a sad and symbolic twist. The baby Jesus — wrapped in a keffiyeh, the black-and-white checkered scarf that has become a badge of Palestinian identity — is lying not in a makeshift cradle of hay and wood. Instead, he lies among the rubble of broken bricks, stones and tiles that represent so much of Gaza’s destruction. “We’ve been glued to our screens, seeing children pulled from under the rubble day after day. We’re broken by these images,” said the Rev. Munther Isaac, the pastor at the Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church who created the crèche. “God is under the rubble in Gaza, this is where we find God right now.” The war began on Oct. 7, in response to Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel that left about 1,200 dead. As the conflict enters its third month, some of the most ubiquitous images of the death and destruction have been of dead Palestinian children being pulled from the ruins of Israeli airstrikes. Nearlyhalfof Gaza’s population of 2.2 million are children, and about 70 percent of those killed are women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the United Nations. Sea of Galilee 30 miles ISRAEl Mediterranean Sea Jordan West Bank Tel Aviv Jerusalem Bethlehem Dead Sea GAZA STRIP By The New York Times The ministry says about 20,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. Though Gaza is some 70 kilometers from Bethlehem, which is in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinians in the city feel it acutely. They fret about family and friends in Gaza, and find their own lives restricted — whether through more draconian Israeli limits since the war began on movement into and out of the city, the economic fallout of the war, or canceled Christmas celebrations.

ByBen HubbardandRoni Caryn Rabin United Nations and other aid officials warned on Saturday that a new U.N. Security Council resolution calling for stepped-up aid delivery to the increasingly hungry and sick civilians of the Gaza Strip would fail to stop the spiraling humanitarian crisis because it did not demand a full halt to the fighting. Theresolution approved on Fridaydirects the secretary general of the United Nations to appoint a special coordinator for aid to Gaza and establish a mechanism to speed up delivery of desperately needed food, water, fuel and medicine, but it does not mandate a truce. Even if enough aid were to cross the border, aid officials said, without a cease-fire, they would be unable to distribute it amid Israel’s frequent airstrikes and a ground invasion that has turned much of the territory into an active combat zone. “Right now, we cannot deploy humanitarian aid. It’s impossible,” said Guillemette Thomas, the medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Jerusalem. “People need to be able to get food and water without the fear of being bombed or killed or shot at any moment,” she added. “We need to be able to move within the strip to access people.” It was not clear on Saturday how soon the special coordinator for aid to Gaza would be appointed or what the first steps would be. After 11 weeks of war, international alarm has risen over the plight of the territory’s more than two million people, increasingly cut off from the outside world, most of them displaced from their homes and packed into overcrowded, unsanitary conditions in apartments, shelters, hospitals, schools and makeshift camps. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gazan Health Ministry, about 70 percent of them women and children, mostly in the fierce Israeli aerial bombardment, according to the health authorities in Gaza.

War Has Smashed Assumptions About Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/world/europe/israeli-hamas-middle-east-implications.html,2023-10-23T14:09:50+0000,"Some paradigms taken for granted about Israel and the Palestinians, both in Gaza and the West Bank, have been broken.

So has the idea that Washington can ignore the Middle East. BySteven Erlanger Reporting from Jerusalem The sudden and unexpected terror attack by Hamas into Israel has been a crushing blow to a host of assumptions that have defined the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for years. Israelis compare the invasion and deaths of some 1,400 Israelis, most of them civilians, to the toll of Sept. 11, 2001, in the United States. And they compare the shocking surprise of the Hamas attack both to Sept. 11 and the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when Israeli forces were unprepared for an Arab attack led by Egypt and Syria that also exploded widely held assumptions. Here are four paradigms now in shatters: For many years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel carried out a strategy designed to split the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza. He worked to weaken the power of the Palestinian Authority, the governing body led by President Mahmoud Abbas, by allowing Hamas to retain control over Gaza. The theory was that Hamas, supported financially by Qatar, would concentrate more on governing the enclave, and might become more moderate through that responsibility, while also ensuring that it did not hit Israel so hard as to engender a huge military response that would undermine its rule. The conception, as the Israelis like to call it, was to allow Gazans to live better and thus incentivize Hamas to maintain relative calm. In practice, that meant Israel allowed Qatar to fund the Hamas government, while providing essentially free electricity and enough water, food and medicine for people to get by. Israel allowed a small number of Gazans to work in Israel, but, with Egypt, kept most of the population locked inside what many called “an open air prison.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Fida Shehada is a member of the City Council of Lod, a town of some 84,000 people, perhaps 30 percent of them Arab citizens of Israel. And Ms. Shehada, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, is afraid, to put it mildly, of what may come now, after the massacre of Israeli civilians by Hamas. “Everyone is in great distress,” she said. “There is a great fear that there will be a mighty revenge.” In Lod, which lies just south of Tel Aviv, Jews and Arabs often live in the same building, she said, but now Arabs are reluctant to go into the air-raid shelters. “They say they see hate in the eyes of the Jews,” Ms. Shehada said. “They say they see hate, but I think what they really see is distress and fear.” Arab citizens of Israel, many of whom want to be identified as Palestinians, make up some 18 percent of the population. They have been caught for years between their loyalty to the state and their desire for an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, the creation of an independent Palestine and a better life for themselves. Now, after this unprecedented killing of Israelis inside Israel, when an enraged Israeli Jewish population is calling for revenge, normal tensions have been raised to almost unbearable levels. The leading Arab politicians in Israel, like Mansour Abbas and Ayman Odeh, both members of the Knesset, have clearly condemned the actions of Hamas, the Palestinian faction that carried out the attack on Israel, and called for calm.

ByHelene CooperandEric Schmitt Reporting from Washington When Iranian-backed militias repeatedly targeted U.S. troops in Syria and Iraq this fall, the Biden administration struck back with force. Action was needed, officials said, to deter the groups from turning Israel’s conflict with Hamas into a wider war. But the United States has not yet retaliated against one Iranian-backed group: the Houthis of Yemen. In the past month alone, the Houthis have launched more than 100 attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea, crippling traffic there. So why has the United States taken a different approach with the Houthis? The reasons are many. The Houthis have launched missiles and drones at vessels in the Red Sea and seized an Israeli-linked ship during more than two months of war between Israel and Hamas. Hamas and the Houthis are both backed by Iran. A Houthi military spokesman, Yahya Sarea, said the attacks would continue “until the Israeli aggression against our steadfast brothers in the Gaza Strip stops.” The U.S.S. Carney, a naval guided-missile destroyer deployed to the region to deter such attacks, has been busy. On one morning last weekend, the ship shot down 14 attack drones that the Houthis had launched at ships in the Red Sea. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Critics say such restrictions are discriminatory. ByErika Solomon Reporting from Berlin Since fleeing Syria a decade ago, Wafa Mustafa has spoken out for political prisoners at the United Nations, held vigils outside war crimes trials and chanted in solidarity withIranians protestingtheir authoritarian government. Her activism won attention and praise in Germany, her adopted country — until she took it to a protest in support of Palestinians. Last month, Ms. Mustafa said the police approached her and a fellow activist in Berlin as they stood on the sidelines of a protest, which the authorities had banned, against theIsraeli bombardment of Gaza. The two were not demonstrating, she said, but wore the black and white Palestinian scarf known as the kaffiyeh. The police pushed her friend to the ground, pinned him down for several minutes and arrested him. Shefilmed the episodewhile demanding an explanation. Instead of getting an answer, she, too, was briefly detained, accused of resisting the police. “What I saw in their eyes is similar to what I saw in the eyes of Assad regime forces,” Ms. Mustafa said, referring toBashar al-Assad, the Syrian dictator. “I know it’s not the same, but that is how I felt,” she said. “When you look into their eyes, there is nothing. You cannot talk with them, you cannot discuss with them. You cannot ask them, ‘What are you doing?’” SinceHamas’s Oct. 7 attackson Israel and Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza, governments across Europe have grappled with how the conflict has played out in their own countries. Some, citing security fears, have imposed stiff restrictions on pro-Palestinian protests in particular or banned them altogether, raising concerns about the violation of civil liberties.

Security Council approved a measure that called on Israel and Hamas to pause the fighting to allow for the delivery of more humanitarian aid. ByFarnaz FassihiandMichael Levenson The United Nations Security Council on Friday adopted a resolution that would allow more aid to reach desperate civilians in the Gaza Strip, ending nearly a week of intense diplomatic wrangling intended to prevent the United States from blocking the measure. But the resolution stopped short of past attempts to impose a cease-fire. The vote was 13 to 0, with the United States and Russia abstaining. The resolution was adopted after diplomats repeatedly delayed the vote this week and reworked the measure in heated negotiations aimed at winning support from the United States, which previously vetoed two resolutions that called for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas. The measure did not impose a legally binding cease-fire and instead called for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip for a sufficient number of days to enable full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access.” It also dropped from earlier drafts demands for the “urgent suspension of hostilities,” replacing them with more watered-down language that recommended creating “the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.” “We know this is not a perfect text,” Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, the U.N. ambassador from the United Arab Emirates, told the Security Council on Friday. “We know only a cease-fire will end the suffering.” But she added, “The purpose of the text is very simple: It responds with action to the dire humanitarian situation on the ground for the Palestinian people bearing the brunt of this conflict, while protecting those who are trying to deliver lifesaving aid.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

U.S. Cites ‘High Confidence’ That Palestinian Rocket Caused Hospital Blast,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/us/politics/intel-rocket-gaza-hospital-blast.html,2023-10-25T00:38:17+0000,American intelligence agencies released no new declassified imagery or other new evidence to make their case.

Officials said their strengthened assessment was based on video evidence. ByJulian E. BarnesandDavid E. Sanger Julian E. Barnes and David E. Sanger, who have covered national security and intelligence issues for several decades, reported from Washington. American intelligence officials said Tuesday they now had “high confidence” that the blast at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza last week was the result of a Palestinian rocket that broke up mid-flight, and that no Israeli weapon was involved in the explosion. The officials said, however, that numerous mysteries still remained about the incident. Those include how many people were killed or injured when, by the U.S. account, the warhead of a Palestinian rocket landed in the parking lot of the hospital. But they said there was little damage to the hospital itself, and no collapse of the structure. U.S. intelligence agencies released no new imagery or other new evidence to make their case. Instead, they said their strengthened assessment came from Israeli intercepts of Palestinian armed groups and publicly available video. Those videos, the U.S. officials said, allowed them to assess that the rocket was launched from Gaza and, after a “catastrophic motor failure,” the warhead fell on the hospital’s parking lot. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information, said there was no evidence an Israeli launch could have been responsible. A U.S. intelligence official said the analysis of the videos has focused primarily on one recorded by Al Jazeera, though there are multiplevideos of projectiles in the skies and the explosion at the hospital. The U.S. intelligence analysis of the Al Jazeera video is at odds with aNew York Times investigation, which found that the projectile shown in that video and others was launched from Israel and exploded well away from the hospital. A spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said The Times and intelligence agencies had different interpretations of the video. U.S. officials said their assessment was also based on communications intercepts provided by the Israelis and images of the explosion and aftermath. Last week, U.S. officials said their early intelligence showed that the blast was caused by an armed Palestinian group, rebutting Palestinian claims that an Israeli strike caused the explosion. U.S. spy agencies did not release detailed evidence at the time to support their assessment. On Tuesday, U.S. intelligence officials reaffirmed their assessment that Israel was not responsible for the explosion. The evaluation reflected a higher degree of certainty by U.S. intelligence officials that Israel was not responsible for the blast. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByRoger Cohen Reporting from Jerusalem Eight years after the foundation of the state of Israel, Moshe Dayan, the chief of staff of the Israeli military, stood close to the Gaza border to pronounce a eulogy for a 21-year-old Israeli security officer slain by Palestinian and Egyptian assailants. “Let us not today cast blame on his murderers,” he said in 1956. “What can we say against their terrible hatred of us? For eight years now, they have sat in the refugee camps of Gaza and have watched how, before their very eyes, we have turned their land and villages, where they and their forefathers previously dwelled, into our home.” His short speech, a little longer than Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address and a powerful reference for Israelis, is perhaps recalled less for this insight into Palestinian anger than for Mr. Dayan’s resolute conclusion. “Without the steel helmet and the cannon’s maw, we will not be able to plant a tree and build a home,” he said. Today, 67 years later, at a time when Jews have again lost their lives to Palestinian gunmen at the same kibbutz, Nahal Oz, that Roi Rotberg guarded, Mr. Dayan’s explicit evocation of the sources of Palestinian “hatred and desire for revenge” remains rare in Israel.

ByMichael Crowley Reporting from Washington Days of intense negotiations enabled the Biden administration to avoid casting a veto at the United Nations Security Council in defense of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. Butabstaining from a resolutiondesigned to help more humanitarian aid reach Gaza only limited the damage to America’s standing around the world as it becomes an increasingly lonely protector of Israel. The outcome was a relief to U.S. officials loath to exercise America’s veto power in defense of Israel for what would have been the third time since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks. Abstaining from a 13-0 vote may look better than casting a veto — which President Biden has said should be reserved for “rare, extraordinary situations” — but it still may not help America’s image abroad. It is one reason, with the year drawing to a close, that the United States finds itself diplomatically isolated and in a defensive crouch. That isolation is a dramatic turnaround in international perceptions for the Biden administration: For most of the past two years, top U.S. officials led what they saw as a valiant crusade to rally the world against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Biden and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken were praised at home and abroad for uniting allies under the banner of American leadership as they invoked basic principles of international law and human rights. “Putin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the world,” Mr. Biden boasted in February in his State of the Union address. “Together, we did what America always does at our best. We led. We united NATO and built a global coalition.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

While it has been reviewed by human transcribers, it may contain errors. Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions. From “The New York Times,” I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today, in a major new poll, “The Times” tries to understand how Americans really feel about the war in Gaza, President Biden’s role in the conflict, and perhaps most revealingly, about the state of Israel itself. My colleague, Jonathan Weisman, explains. It’s Friday, December 22. Jonathan, the war between Israel and Hamas has become — and I’m not telling you anything you don’t already know — a source of profound division in the United States. You can see that from the protests on college campuses and in big cities, from the strong emotions that are pouring forth on social media, and from the political conversation in Washington. And yet, it’s been very hard to actually measure any of it. But “The Times” has now tried to do just that. That’s right. We went out to try to ascertain where Americans, as a whole, are. And we talked to registered voters, and we asked them two sets of questions — one about how President Biden is handling this conflict, and the other about Israel itself and Israel’s handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza. OK, well, let’s start with what the poll found when it comes to the first of those two areas of questions — how Americans see President Biden’s handling of the war. I mean, registered voters clearly disapprove of the way President Biden has been handling this conflict. 57 percent say they disapprove, and only 33 percent said they approved of the way the President has been handling the war in Gaza. So what exactly does this poll reveal about what’s behind those high disapproval numbers? On the one hand, those numbers are striking, because Israel is historically such a close ally of the US, and Biden has been so unwaveringly supportive of it. On the other hand, it’s perhaps not that surprising at all, because of how much anger Israel’s retaliation for October 7 — the extremely high death toll in Gaza — has inspired among Americans. Well, the signals being sent to President Biden are decidedly mixed. You have 44 percent saying, end the war now, regardless of whether the hostages have been released or not, but nearly the same number, 39 percent, saying, no, they want Israel to keep pressing their war on Hamas until either all of the hostages are out or Hamas has been destroyed. So that shows a real split in where Americans actually are. Well, how do you make sense of that? Because those do seem like confusing signals — a majority disapproving of the President’s handling, but then a pretty even split between what they want him to actually do that signals how he might get out of their disapproval. It’s tricky, because that 57 percent that disapprove of the way Biden is handling it is divided itself. Some of those people say Biden has been too pro-Israel, and some other people think that Biden is too supportive of the Palestinians, and maybe not being tough enough on Hamas. OK, so how does this broad disapproval and this more or less even split among voters over what they want Biden to do — how does it break down by party? Well, let’s look at Republicans. 93 percent of Republicans disapprove broadly of the way President Biden is doing his job. But 78 percent disapprove of the way Biden is handling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. So as you see, there is a dropoff. Right. More approve of his actions toward Israel than approve of him in general. Why is that? Well, you know, among Republicans, Israel is just a more popular political entity. So if Joe Biden is broadly perceived as being pro-Israel, a certain number of Republicans will give him credit for that. Right. OK. So what about Democrats and their views of how he’s handling the war? It’s kind of the converse. I mean, the fact is, Biden has pretty much consolidated support among Democrats. 8 out of 10 Democrats support the way President Biden is handling his job. But on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, just over 1/2 approve of the way he’s handling it. That’s a very big gap. Yes. So whereas Biden’s approach to the war is polling slightly better with Republicans than he’s polling with them overall, with Democrats, he’s polling worse on his approach to the war than he’s polling with Democrats overall, which is really fascinating. Basically, he has disillusioned his own party with the way he has handled the conflict. That’s right. And that’s, in part, a reflection of the generation gap within the Democratic party. Democrats skew young, and young people really, really feel badly about the way this war is being handled and about the conduct that Israel is engaging in, in Gaza. Say more about that. It feels very important to understanding this poll. Remember, in July, when “The Times” last polled voters on how they’re feeling, these young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 sided with Joe Biden over Donald Trump by 10 percentage points. Now, this young demographic is siding with Trump by 6 percentage points. That’s a huge flip. OK, Jonathan. Does the poll allow you to truly attribute that phenomenon of young voters essentially starting to flee Biden and, to some extent, flipping over to Trump, which is not entirely intuitive to the war? Because we know from past polling that Biden was losing support with young people, so that was already kind of a trajectory. So how should we think about that? It’s very difficult to tease out all of the factors. And when you look at the poll overall, if you ask people what their dominant concerns are, it’s still the economics. And their impression of the economy is certainly coloring their views of President Biden. The economic picture is actually improving. But between July and now, we’ve had the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israelis and the ensuing war. So you have these two factors playing at the same time. And it seems to me that the war in Gaza is just a millstone around Biden’s neck, preventing a comeback among those younger voters. Right. Something very big changed since July, and it wasn’t, as you’re saying, really the economy. It was the war in Gaza that President Biden has articulated pretty much unwavering moral support for. But what about older voters? I’m going to deduce, because you haven’t said that older voters, like younger voters, are turning on Biden over this war, that they’re not. And that’s a pretty important group of voters for Biden. Traditionally, 65 and up is the voting bloc that votes most, that is consistently at the polls. And for those people, 52 percent approve of the way Biden is handling the conflict, against 40 who disapprove. Those aren’t huge numbers, but if you look at all the age brackets, that’s pretty remarkable, considering 30 percent approve among Gen X voters, 26 percent approve among 30 - to 44-year-olds, Millennials, and only 20 percent approve of Biden’s handling of the conflict among 18 - to 29-year-olds — 20 percent. So if you’re Joe Biden and you’re thinking, well, what am I supposed to do, you could look at that 52 percent and say, well, those guys vote. Should I change course and alienate 65-year-olds and up who like what I’m doing? It’s a tough decision for the President. Right. Because there’s a bit of a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t.” If the President were to be highly responsive to young voters, who have soured on his handling of the war, he risks alienating older voters, who haven’t. So there’s no blindingly obvious course of action for President Biden in terms of public opinion and turning it around. And so perhaps Biden’s most logical answer is to do what it seems he has been doing since October 7, which is to kind of follow his instinct, even if that ends up alienating some young voters. There’s no real evidence at all that President Biden is shaping his policy according to politics or the will of the people. And given the “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” message from this poll for President Biden, you know, we know that this war is going to wind down, for no other reason than the United States wants it to wind down. So as a long-term political conundrum, he can wait it out. The real message that we learned from this poll has more to do with how Americans view Israel and their country’s relationship with it, and what that means for the Jewish state in the long run. We’ll be right back. OK, Jonathan, what exactly does this poll tell us about how Americans view Israel and America’s relationship to Israel? You mentioned before the break that the real meaning of this poll is not how Americans think of Biden in this moment but how they think of Israel. So describe what the poll actually found. Now, if you look overall, Americans do have positive feelings about Israel. They are more sympathetic to the Israelis than the Palestinians, and in general, they want America to side with Israel, to supply Israel with arms and aid. But when you look at young voters, the change is dramatic. Very few of them believe Israel is serious about peace with the Palestinians. Nearly half say Israel is intentionally killing civilians. That is a bad sign. I mean, that’s a bad thing to do. And nearly 3/4 say Israel is not taking enough precautions to avoid civilian casualties. A majority of those young voters actually oppose additional economic, military aid. That portends a huge shift in America’s relationship with Israel. Right. And so what you’re left with is a very clear understanding that this younger group of Americans — in a sense, America’s future — is very skeptical of Israel. And maybe “skeptical” isn’t even the right word for it, not strong-enough word for it, based on what you just said. They disapprove of its conduct. Yes. And what’s remarkable is that there is a linear progression of this ill will coming as you go down from the older generations to the youngest generations. Well, just explain that — the concept of a linear progression here. So if you’re from the silent generation, like Joe Biden — you’re over 70, 80 years old — that means you were alive during the Holocaust and the founding of Israel. You maybe know people who lived through those defining moments. And you’re more likely to have a strong feeling about the need for Israel and the US to support it. Remember, the United States was the first nation in the world to recognize Israel as a sovereign country in 1948. The Baby Boom generation might not have been old enough to remember the establishment of the Israeli state, but they do remember 1967 and the Six-Day War in which Israel fended off attacks from all of its Arab neighbors and looked heroic. They remember the 1973 War, the Yom Kippur War, when a sneak attack nearly destroyed Israel. And at that time, America’s support for Israel is unquestioned and copious. That’s when you started seeing, year after year, Congress, without question, allocating more aid to Israel than any country in the world. Generation X may not have seen those wars, but they saw a peace process. They saw Israeli governments vacillate between liberal and conservative, and Israelis seemed serious about reaching some kind of peace accord with their Arab neighbors and with the Palestinians that would lead to two nations, side by side, reaching some kind of settlement. And what does that do for the view of Generation X toward Israel? So Generation X might not have as monolithic support as much older generations. But Generation X members still tend to favor Israelis over Palestinians. About 57 percent in our poll said they are more sympathetic to the Israelis than the Palestinians in the current conflict. So for this generation, you remember Bill Clinton shuttling between the United States from Washington to Tel Aviv. You remember the Oslo Accords. And for an American president, peace between Israel and Palestine is kind of the brass ring, the thing that you want the most. Right. OK. So what’s next? Then, we move on to Millennials. Millennials remember, of course, 9/11 and a sense that the Middle East is a divisive place, a place where Americans are fighting. There is a division in Americans about whether or not our troops, our money, and resources should even be dumping into this area. And Millennials don’t remember a peace process. What they remember is the rise of the Right in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu becoming a fixture of Israeli politics and bluntly declaring that he doesn’t want a two-state solution, he doesn’t want peace with the Palestinians. Their sense — Millennials’ sense — is that he wants to crush them. Right. And so here, we see an important turning point in that linear progression you described just a couple of moments ago. Millennial Americans have a profoundly different experience of Israel with their own eyes than the silent generation who watched Israel be born or the Baby Boomer generation that watched this little country that could and somehow overcome its bigger Arab rivals’ armies. This feels like a very important moment. It is. And we see it in the numbers. If you look at our poll, the ages between 30 and 44 — only 36 percent say that they are more sympathetic toward Israel than the Palestinians in the current conflict. 36 percent — that is a linear decline from the older generations. And that leads us to the current generation, the 18 - to 29-year-olds. With the 18 - to 29-year-olds, only 27 percent said they sympathize with Israelis. 46 percent said they sympathize with the Palestinians. This is the first generation in which that split is so decisive in the Palestinians’ favor. They don’t remember peace processes. They only remember an Israel that is powerful, that is not interested in peace with the Palestinians. They see a bullying superpower in the Middle East, and they don’t like it. So what a meaningful number of this generation, Generation Z — how they see Israel is less and less as a victim as previous generations did, and instead increasingly see Israel as a victimizer. That’s right. And they look at what’s happening in Washington with their government, and they see US military aid to Israel as increasingly important and increasingly identifiable. For instance, if you look at Iron Dome, this missile defense system in Israel, it’s built and engineered with help from the United States. The missiles that shoot down missiles being fired at Israel, especially from Hamas — parts of those missiles are made in America. There is a sense that America is deeply entrenched in Israel, and Israel is not a nation that these youngest voters sympathize with. And now, you’re starting to see mainstream Democrats — not from the fringe Left, but the center of the party — at least talking about attaching conditions to military aid to Israel. Such conditions are routine with other countries. I mean, we’ve been attaching conditions to aid to Pakistan for decades. But with Israel, that support has always been unconditional. This is a very big change for US-Israel relations. And just to bring it back to the poll, Jonathan — each generation’s experience seems to be projected onto this moment, and that’s how you get this linear progression, decline, of American support for Israel. That’s right. Politics are personal. And the way somebody, some voter, experiences history will impact his or her feelings about political issues. And ultimately, aid to Israel is a political issue. And I think — Right. — we can project forward only so much. I mean, the fact is that somebody who’s 25 years old may feel differently in the future. But the numbers are so dramatic. When you see only 27 percent of this age cohort sympathizing with Israel, you have to think that there will be residual impacts as these people grow into the power structure of the United States. Right. And the natural conclusion of everything you have just described in this poll is that when they are running the country, they will bring a fair amount of skepticism toward Israel. And so the question becomes, is Israel prepared to live in a world where US support is meaningfully lower, where strings and conditions are attached, or even in a world where it doesn’t really have much US support? Or if it’s not willing to live in that world, will it, do we think, make it a priority to appeal to these younger Americans in order to maintain US support going forward? I think this is a huge question for Israel. There are voices in Israel that very much want to go it alone, that say, we will do what we need to do to survive, and we don’t care what the international community says. Those people were already willing to challenge or actually thumb their nose at America. Remember, Netanyahu, at one time, went around Barack Obama’s back and addressed Congress at the invitation of Republicans. He was willing to have ruptures in the US-Israel support system. Right. And it’s very possible that Netanyahu was willing to do what he did to Obama because, on some level, he believed — and he has a lot of reason to believe it — that the United States would never really punish him or Israel for all that defiant and insulting act to Obama, because its commitment is so deep. Right. And that was a long time ago. You know, if we look at generation to generation, we see how events that generation lived through really impacted that generation’s view of US-Israel relations. Well, young voters of today had already started souring on an Israel led by Benjamin Netanyahu, and now, this generation now has its seminal event. And that seminal event, the war in Gaza, is not creating an impression to turn that erosion around. I want to try to end this conversation by bringing all of this together — how Americans are viewing Biden’s handling of the war, the first half of our conversation, and the second half — how they are viewing Israel. The current dynamic of a US president who is as supportive of Israel as Biden is, and what Israel’s current government is doing, and how it approaches this war and the world, this right-wing government — when you put those together, it suggests that the disillusionment of young Americans is quite likely to deepen and that it will very likely accelerate what could become a deeply strained dynamic between the United States and Israel. That’s possible, and that’s one way to look at it. But remember, before the Hamas attacks on Israel, Israel itself was deeply divided. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were in the streets, calling for Netanyahu to step down or to change course. And now, 76 percent of Israelis disapprove of the job Netanyahu is doing. They want him gone. So there could be a major, major shift coming out of this war in Israel itself that might, might, rejuvenate a sense of Israel as a thriving democracy that could seek some solution between the Israelis and the Palestinians after this horrible, horrible war. And basically, you’re saying that what we’re not accounting for in this moment is the kind of profound internal change in Israel that might result from this war and from, perhaps, the removal to the Netanyahu government. It seems very possible, what you just laid out, and that successor government, with a new set of incentives and priorities, might — as you said, might — change the way that younger Americans see Israel. Israel is a young and dynamic democracy. It certainly has its flaws. Some people might even say those flaws are so profound that it isn’t a democracy. But Israel has found its way forward when it faced existential questions. But when this war ends, Israel understands that this kind of bloodletting on both sides, in which, according to officials on each side, about 20,000 Palestinians have lost their lives, and at least 1,200 Israelis have lost their lives, this cannot be the new norm. And for the United States, the US also has to recalibrate its approach to Israel that is perhaps more complicated than the unquestioned support that we’ve seen for decades now. Well, Jonathan, thank you very much. Thank you. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. On Thursday, a gunman killed at least 15 people in and around the Czech Republic capital of Prague in one of the worst mass killings in Europe in nearly a decade. Most of the victims were killed on the campus of Charles University in Central Prague. Police said that the shooter is now dead but offered no motive for his actions. And Rudy Giuliani filed for bankruptcy on Thursday after a judge ordered him to begin paying nearly $150 million in damages to two former Georgia election workers for spreading lies that they had tried to steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump. Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City, was found liable in August for defaming the two workers when he baselessly claimed that they tried to manipulate ballots in Fulton County.

Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions. From “The New York Times,” I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today, in a major new poll, “The Times” tries to understand how Americans really feel about the war in Gaza, President Biden’s role in the conflict, and perhaps most revealingly, about the state of Israel itself. My colleague, Jonathan Weisman, explains. It’s Friday, December 22. Jonathan, the war between Israel and Hamas has become — and I’m not telling you anything you don’t already know — a source of profound division in the United States. You can see that from the protests on college campuses and in big cities, from the strong emotions that are pouring forth on social media, and from the political conversation in Washington. And yet, it’s been very hard to actually measure any of it. But “The Times” has now tried to do just that. That’s right. We went out to try to ascertain where Americans, as a whole, are. And we talked to registered voters, and we asked them two sets of questions — one about how President Biden is handling this conflict, and the other about Israel itself and Israel’s handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza. OK, well, let’s start with what the poll found when it comes to the first of those two areas of questions — how Americans see President Biden’s handling of the war. I mean, registered voters clearly disapprove of the way President Biden has been handling this conflict. 57 percent say they disapprove, and only 33 percent said they approved of the way the President has been handling the war in Gaza. So what exactly does this poll reveal about what’s behind those high disapproval numbers? On the one hand, those numbers are striking, because Israel is historically such a close ally of the US, and Biden has been so unwaveringly supportive of it. On the other hand, it’s perhaps not that surprising at all, because of how much anger Israel’s retaliation for October 7 — the extremely high death toll in Gaza — has inspired among Americans. Well, the signals being sent to President Biden are decidedly mixed. You have 44 percent saying, end the war now, regardless of whether the hostages have been released or not, but nearly the same number, 39 percent, saying, no, they want Israel to keep pressing their war on Hamas until either all of the hostages are out or Hamas has been destroyed. So that shows a real split in where Americans actually are. Well, how do you make sense of that? Because those do seem like confusing signals — a majority disapproving of the President’s handling, but then a pretty even split between what they want him to actually do that signals how he might get out of their disapproval. It’s tricky, because that 57 percent that disapprove of the way Biden is handling it is divided itself. Some of those people say Biden has been too pro-Israel, and some other people think that Biden is too supportive of the Palestinians, and maybe not being tough enough on Hamas. OK, so how does this broad disapproval and this more or less even split among voters over what they want Biden to do — how does it break down by party? Well, let’s look at Republicans. 93 percent of Republicans disapprove broadly of the way President Biden is doing his job. But 78 percent disapprove of the way Biden is handling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. So as you see, there is a dropoff. Right. More approve of his actions toward Israel than approve of him in general. Why is that? Well, you know, among Republicans, Israel is just a more popular political entity. So if Joe Biden is broadly perceived as being pro-Israel, a certain number of Republicans will give him credit for that. Right. OK.

ByBen Hubbard Reporting from Beirut, Lebanon As the Israeli bombardment of Gaza has intensified in recent days, large protests have erupted across the Arab and Muslim worlds in support of the Palestinian cause, a reminder of the profound resonance the issue still holds for many. That popular outpouring has put new pressures on Arab leaders, many of whom have invested little effort in recent years to support the Palestinians or advance their political or economic interests. Now, those leaders must navigate the pursuit of what they consider their own countries’ interests while indicating to their people that they, too, are supporting the Palestinian cause. “The Israeli-Palestinian conflict was relegated to the background, partly because of apathy and partly because of a feeling of helplessness that was pervasive in the Arab world,” said Lina Khatib, the director of theSOAS Middle East Instituteat the University of London. The climate shifted noticeably after Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls Gaza, attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7 and killed roughly 1,400 people. That unleashed a barrage of Israeli airstrikes on the crowded and impoverished Gaza Strip that Gaza health authorities say have killed thousands. The violence has displaced about half of Gaza’s population of more than 2 million Palestinians, according to the United Nations. “The tragic events have shown that it remains at the heart of Middle Eastern politics and a major concern for people across the region,” Ms. Khatib said of the Palestinian struggle.

Pleas to “Free Gaza.”,"Israel-HamasWar Advertisement The site listed thousands of people and grouped them by their workplaces after they posted on the Israeli-Hamas conflict. ByRyan Mac Technology reporter Online posts asking to “#PrayForPalestine.” Entreaties for peace. Pleas to “Free Gaza.” Over the last 10 days, a website called anti-israel-employees.com published more than 17,000 posts, which one of the people behind the site said had been taken mainly from LinkedIn. The site, which claimed to be a “global live feed of potentially supportive sentiments for terrorism among company employees,” listed thousands of people and grouped them by their workplaces, in an apparent attempt to shame them for their sentiments on the Israeli-Hamas conflict. The website, which was taken offline for a day before being migrated to a new web address, named employees of major international corporations, including Amazon, Mastercard and Ernst & Young, and shared their profile photos, LinkedIn pages and posts. Itai Liptz, a hedge fund manager who said he was one of the people behind the original site, said that its goal was to “expose people who supported Hamas publicly.” “We wanted to have it documented and a record,” he said. “If I work in this company, but I see my friends on LinkedIn celebrating and praising Hamas, then I’m not feeling safe.” But the site also highlighted posts from people who did not explicitly show support for Hamas, according to posts seen by The New York Times. Some people used hash tags like “#GazaUnderAttack” or sought to draw attention to the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.

But many believe it can be credible now only if it includes Hamas. BySteven Erlanger Reporting from Ramallah in the West Bank and from East Jerusalem Lanky and lightly bearded, Jihad Imtoor is the proud son of a fighter killed in the first intifada, or uprising, against Israel. His father was a member of Fatah, the political faction that controls the Palestinian Authority. But he has had enough of its rule in the West Bank. On a recent day, Mr. Imtoor, 32, a small-business owner, stood outside his shop, watching a march for the many Palestinians detained in Israeli jails, whom Hamas saysit is trying to freeas part of a deal for a cease-fire in Gaza. “I’m not Hamas, but I hope it comes here,” he said. “The P.A. has taken a lot from us, and it’s time for them to go.” Referring to the monument in the center of Ramallah, he said: “The P.A. is working fine to protect the four lions on Manara Square, but they cannot protect the people from Israel.” President Biden and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken have said that afterthe latest war, Gazashould be unifiedwith the Israeli-occupied West Bankunder a “revitalized” Palestinian Authority, which controls large parts of the West Bank in close coordination, some say collaboration, with Israel. Today few people in the West Bank or Israel regard the authority as capable of governing a post-conflict Gaza. The authority is deeply unpopular even where it has control in the West Bank, because it is seen as a subcontractor to the long Israeli occupation.

A Times Investigation Tracked Israel’s Use of One of Its Most Destructive Bombs in South Gaza,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-bomb-investigation.html,2023-12-22T04:47:50+0000,A Times visual investigation reveals that one of Israel’s largest munitions was regularly being dropped in areas designated safe for i,"During the first six weeks of the war in Gaza, Israel routinely used one of its biggest and most destructive bombs in areas it designated safe for civilians, according to an analysis of visual evidence by The New York Times.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Supported by Visual Investigations  transcript This is an area in Gaza where, for weeks, civilians fled to find safety. [explosions] These are 2,000-pound bombs, one of the most destructive munitions in Western military arsenals. When a 2,000-pound bomb detonates, it unleashes a blast wave and metal fragments thousands of feet in every direction. [non-English speech] Sometimes, 2,000-pound bombs leave giant craters in the earth, like this strike in south Gaza in November. [non-English speech] [non-English speech] [non-English speech] [non-English speech] [non-English speech] [non-English speech] Munitions experts say 2,000-pound bombs are almost never used by the U.S. military anymore in densely populated areas. [non-English speech] Israel says it must destroy Hamas above and below ground to prevent terrorist attacks like Oct. 7 — [shouting] — and claims it’s taking extraordinary measures to protect civilians. But a Times investigation using aerial imagery and artificial intelligence found visual evidence suggesting Israel used these munitions in the area it designated safe for civilians at least 200 times. Our analysis indicates 2,000-pound bombs were dropped on a routine basis in south Gaza during the first six weeks of the war. And it suggests that even for those who followed every Israeli evacuation order and advisory, there was still no safety to be found in a war zone that’s more dangerous for civilians than any in recent history. Amplifying the danger are many factors. Hamas intentionally uses dense civilian areas to position military personnel and weapons. [explosion] Buried underground are vast tunnel networks used by Hamas fighters, but no bomb shelters for civilians. When the war started, Israel completely sealed off Gaza’s borders and claimed it was going to keep civilians out of the crossfire by establishing a safe zone and issuing evacuation orders. By air, phone — [non-English speech] — and social media, over a million people living in northern Gaza were told they must move to the south to be safe. “The I.D.F. is calling for the people of Gaza to evacuate to southern Gaza.” “To go south.” “South of this river.” [non-English speech] “Move south. For your own safety, move south.” But the evacuation routes and the safe zone were anything but safe. [non-English speech] How often the attacks were launched by Hamas is unclear. [non-English speech] But visual evidence indicates Israel was dropping 2,000-pound bombs in the area it was ordering civilians to go. The Times programmed an artificial intelligence tool to analyze satellite imagery of south Gaza to search for bomb craters. The A.I. tool detected over 1,600 possible craters. We manually reviewed each one to weed out the false positives, like shadows, water towers or bomb craters from a previous conflict. We measured the remaining craters to find ones that spanned roughly 40 feet across or more, which experts say are typically formed only by 2,000-pound bombs. Ultimately, we identified 208 of these craters in satellite imagery and drone footage, indicating 2,000-pound bombs posed a pervasive threat to civilians seeking safety across south Gaza. It’s likely that more of these bombs were used than what was captured in our reporting. Because of limited satellite imagery, our analysis omits parts of south Gaza. And military experts say that often, depending on the target, fuse and type of soil, a 2,000-pound bomb may not leave a crater at all. Even bomb craters that are visible from the sky do not convey the destruction unleashed on the ground. This crater in central Khan Younis was from an airstrike in October. [shouting] More than a dozen people were reportedly killed. Scores were injured or buried under the rubble. Hours later, Israel took responsibility, posting video of the strike and a photo of the alleged target — a top Hamas official they said was key in planning the Oct. 7 attack. Israel has said it must take out Hamas leaders no matter where they’re hiding. “Our goal — and we’re taking extraordinary efforts to achieve it — is to minimize civilian casualties. This is our ethos. And here’s the problem: We’re faced with the most vicious kind of enemy, who not only attacks civilians, but commits the other war crime of deliberately hiding behind their civilians. They use them as human shields.” In response to questions about the use of 2,000-pound bombs in south Gaza, an Israeli military spokesman told The Times that Israel’s priority is destroying Hamas, and, quote, “questions of this kind will be looked into at a later stage.” They also said that, quote, “in stark contrast to Hamas’s intentional attacks,” the I.D.F., quote, “follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.” But the U.S. says Israel must do more to avoid civilian casualties. The Pentagon recently increased shipments of a smaller bomb called the GBU-39, which U.S. officials say can strike underground targets and is better suited to urban environments like Gaza. The GBU-39, one of the smallest bombs in Israel’s arsenal, has the explosive power of 37 pounds of TNT. Compare that to the Mark 84, a 2,000-pound bomb which has 25 times more explosive power. When a GBU-39 detonates on impact, its blast wave can injure or kill people in open areas over 1,000 feet away in every direction. The danger from a Mark 84’s blast wave stretches almost three times further. For both, even more danger comes from the fragmentation — [explosion] — the metal shards of the bomb casings that can shoot out hundreds of feet from the point of impact. [shouting and sirens] The GBU-39 is still deadly, but overall, it’s much less destructive. U.S. officials told The Times that the I.D.F. has many more 2,000-pound bombs in its arsenal. They said Israel is heavily relying on them because they’re more effective than the smaller bombs at destroying Hamas’s tunnel network as fast as possible. The officials also said that in the Gaza war, Israel has demonstrated a higher tolerance than the U.S. military for causing civilian casualties. But the U.S. has not stopped supplying weapons to Israel. Since the war in Gaza began, the U.S. has sent more than 5,000 2,000-pound bombs. [non-English speech] [crying] [non-English speech] In December, Israel announced it was expanding combat operations to south Gaza, and started issuing a new kind of evacuation order targeting neighborhoods, including some in areas previously deemed safe, like this one in Khan Younis. Hours later, 2,000-pound bombs were raining down. [somber music playing] [explosions and glass shattering] ByRobin Stein,Haley Willis,Ishaan Jhaveri,Danielle Miller,Aaron ByrdandNatalie Reneau During the first six weeks of the war in Gaza, Israel routinely used one of its biggest and most destructive bombs in areas it designated safe for civilians, according to an analysis of visual evidence by The New York Times. Thevideo investigationfocuses on the use of 2,000-pound bombs in an area of southern Gaza where Israel had ordered civilians to move for safety. While bombs of that size are used by several Western militaries, munitions experts say they are almost never dropped by U.S. forces in densely populated areas anymore. The Times programmed an artificial intelligence tool to scan satellite imagery of south Gaza for bomb craters. Times reporters manually reviewed the search results, looking for craters measuring roughly 40 feet across or larger. Munitions experts say typically only 2,000-pound bombs form craters of that size in Gaza’s light, sandy soil. Ultimately, the investigation identified 208 craters in satellite imagery and drone footage. Because of limited satellite imagery and variations in a bomb’s effects, there are likely to have been many cases that were not captured. But the findings reveal that 2,000-pound bombs posed a pervasive threat to civilians seeking safety across south Gaza. In response to questions about the bomb’s use in south Gaza, an Israeli military spokesman said in a statement to The Times that Israel’s priority was destroying Hamas and “questions of this kind will be looked into at a later stage.” The spokesman also said that the I.D.F. “takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.” ButU.S. officials have saidthat Israel should do more to reduce civilian casualties while fighting Hamas. The Pentagon increased shipments to Israel of smaller bombs that it considers better suited to urban environments like Gaza. Still, since October, the United States has also sent more than 5,000 MK-84 munitions — a type of 2,000-pound bomb.

Diplomats were focused on who would oversee the inspection of aid entering the enclave. ByFarnaz FassihiandMichael Levenson After nearly a week of intense negotiations, the United States said on Thursday night that it was ready to support a United Nations Security Council resolution that would call for more desperately needed aid to enter the Gaza Strip. A vote was not expected until Friday at the earliest. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters that the United States had “worked hard and diligently over the course of the past week” with the countries that had proposed the resolution, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, to ensure that “we put a mechanism on the ground that will support humanitarian assistance and we’re ready to vote for it.” “I won’t share how I will vote,” she said, but added that if the resolution were put forward as written, it would be one “we can support.” Earlier on Thursday, a U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the talks, said that high-level negotiators from Washington and Cairo had been seeking common ground on who would inspect the aid for weapons and other contraband before it entered Gaza. The draft text of the resolution that circulated before the ambassador spoke dropped a call for the “suspension of hostilities” from an earlier version, instead calling for “urgent steps” to allow unhindered humanitarian access and the creation of “conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.” It also asks the U.N. secretary general to appoint a coordinator given the responsibility for “facilitating, coordinating, monitoring and verifying” that aid cargo is humanitarian in nature, who would also be “consulting all relevant parties.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The Gaza Health Ministry said on Thursday that the death toll had exceeded 20,000 for the first time, putting it just above one of the most authoritative estimates of those killed in Lebanon by Israel’s 1982 invasion. And though Gaza officials have said counting the dead has become increasingly challenging, most experts say the figure is likely an undercount and express shock at the enormity of the loss. Some military experts said more people had been killed more quickly in this war thanduring the deadliest stages of the U.S.-led wars in Afghanistan or Iraq. Azmi Keshawi, the Gaza analyst for the International Crisis Group think tank, said this war was “more horrifying” than any he had experienced before. He said he and his family had fled his home in northern Gaza and moved six times so far. They now live in a tent near a U.N. shelter in the southern city of Rafah. The Israeli military has engaged in an intense air and ground campaign to eliminate Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that rules Gaza and led the Oct. 7 attack that officials say killed about 1,200 people in Israel — the majority of them civilians but also including hundreds of soldiers.

ByVivian Nereim Reporting from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia When the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Moroccoannouncedthat they were establishing relations with Israel in 2020, Emirati officials said the deals were symbols ofpeaceandtolerance, while then President Donald J. Trump declared “the dawn of a new Middle East.” Those words rang hollow to many in the region, though. Even in the countries that signed the deals, branded the Abraham Accords, support for the Palestinians — and enmity toward Israel over its decades-long occupation of their land —remained strong, particularly as Israel’s government expanded settlements in the Palestinian West Bank after the agreements. On Saturday, when Palestinian gunmen from the blockaded territory of Gaza surged into Israel, carrying out the boldest attack in the country in decades, it set off an outpouring of support for the Palestinians across the region. In some quarters, there were celebrations — even as hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians were killed and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel threatened a “long and difficult war” ahead. “This is the first time that we rejoice in this way for our Palestinian brothers,” said Abdul Majeed Abdullah Hassan, 70, who joined a rally with hundreds of people in the island kingdom of Bahrain. In the context of the Israeli occupation and blockade, the Hamas operation “warmed our hearts,” he said, calling his government’s deal to recognize Israel “shameful.” Demonstrations in solidarity with the Palestinians took place across the region, including in Bahrain, Morocco, Turkey, Yemen, Tunisia and Kuwait. In Lebanon, Hashem Safieddine, head of the executive council for the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah, delivered a fiery speech lauding “the era of armed resistance.” And in Egypt’s coastal city of Alexandria, a policeman opened fire on Israeli tourists, killing two Israelis and an Egyptian. The ripples spreading from Gaza underscored what many officials, scholars and citizens in the region have been saying for years: The Palestinian cause is still a deeply felt rallying cry that shapes the contours of the Middle East, and Israel’s position in the region will remain unstable as long as its conflict with the Palestinians continues.

ByMaria Abi-HabibandRami Nazzal Maria Abi-Habib reported from London, and Rami Nazzal from Ramallah Attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are surging, with at least 115 killed, more than 2,000 injured and nearly 1,000 others forcibly displaced from their homes because of violence and intimidation by Israeli forces and settlers since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, according the United Nations. Among the dead are 33 children,according to an update on Sunday from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which has been tracking the conflicts. Confrontations in the West Bank have been a longstanding issue, but the violence has intensified over the last three weeks, more than doubling to seven incidents a day, on average, compared with three incidents a day since the start of 2023, according to the U.N. “We’ve observed more incidents where armed settlers have threatened Palestinians,” Andrea De Domenico, the head of the U.N. humanitarian affairs office, told The New York Times. “In several areas, Palestinians have been ordered to leave under the threat of firearms.” An ever-growing number of Israeli communities have taken root in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967.The settlementscut into land Palestinians have title to and also undermine the territory needed for any two-state solution, fanning tensions in the region. They also draw many residents who consider the West Bank to be Jewish by birthright. In the clashes since Oct. 7, almost half have involved “Israeli forces accompanying or actively supporting Israeli settlers while carrying out the attacks,” according to the U.N. report. The Israeli military declined to comment. In the days after the Oct. 7 attacks, Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, announced that his ministry waspurchasing 10,000 riflesin order to arm civilians, specifying among the intended recipients those in West Bank settlements. Much of the violence in the territory has been directed at herders and Bedouin communities. The U.N. said those Palestinians have faced physical violence and intimidation and also been denied access to their lands, a particular hardship given that many are farmers. The Palestinian hamlet of Khirbet al-Ratheem, in the hills of Hebron, is now completely emptied of its population of about 50 people. Israeli settlers from a nearby outpost began to close roads leading to the hamlet on Oct. 14, according to Palestinians who lived there. On the night of Oct. 14, “they returned to attack us, pointing their guns at us while forcing us all into one room,” said Amir Abdullah Hamdan al-Maharak, a 50-year-old farmer who has seven children. Mr. al-Maharak said that the settlers dragged and shoved his elderly father around the family’s home, and then used their knives to cut through the family’s water barrels and slash the pipes for their propane canisters. Fearing for their lives, he and his family decided to take their sheep and flee. An earlier version of a capsule summary with this article referred imprecisely to those who the U.N. said had killed, injured and forcibly displaced Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.

ByPatrick Kingsley Reporting from Jerusalem Video has emerged of Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, recently asserting that European Jews were persecuted by Hitler because ofwhat he said were their predatory lending practices, rather than their religion. Mr. Abbas’s false claim drew swift condemnation from Israeli and European officials. It also fueled accusations that Mr. Abbas — an architect of interim peace agreements between Israelis and Palestinians in the 1990s — is not genuinely committed to resolving the ongoing conflict. In aspeechlate last month, Mr. Abbas said: “They say that Hitler killed the Jews because they were Jews, and that Europe hated the Jews because they were Jews.” “No,” Mr. Abbas added. Jews were persecuted, he continued, because of “their social role, which had to do with usury, money, and so on.” Mr. Abbas also repeated a widely discredited theory that European, or Ashkenazi, Jews have no ancient roots in the Middle East. Instead, Mr. Abbas claimed that European Jews were the descendants of a nomadic Turkic tribe that converted to Judaism during the medieval period, and therefore were not victims of antisemitism. “When we hear them talk about Semitism and antisemitism — the Ashkenazi Jews, at least, are not Semites,” Mr. Abbas said.

In a town hall held over Zoom on Tuesday with several hundred members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Dr. Gay focused on how to bridge the deep divides that had emerged on campus as a result of the war, according to two people who attended and asked for confidentiality because of the sensitivity of the situation. Faculty members who spoke up in the meeting were largely positive, and there were no questions about Dr. Gay’s academic record afterpublic allegations of plagiarism.The matter wasn’t even raised, one professor said. But by Thursday, new questions surrounding Dr. Gay’s scholarship had shifted to the forefront, after the university said late Wednesday that it had identifiedtwo more instancesof what it called “duplicative language without appropriate attribution,” from her 1997 doctoral dissertation. The examples were part of a wave of plagiarism allegations that had surfaced against Dr. Gay over the past two weeks, driven by conservative activists and news outlets, just as she was under fire for failing to take a tougher stand against antisemitismduring a tense congressional hearingconvened by House Republicans this month. The latest round of allegations have given strength to Dr. Gay’s critics and strained her supporters, while leaving some students and faculty members perplexed just as the campus empties for winter break.

ByBen Hubbard Reporting from Istanbul Fluttering down from the skies over Gaza on a recent day were clouds of fliers dropped by the Israeli military asking for tips on the whereabouts of top Hamas leaders. “The end of Hamas is near,” the fliers proclaimed in Arabic, promising hefty bounties to anyone who helped bring about the arrest of those who had “brought destruction and ruin to the Gaza Strip.” The Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, headed the list in exchange for a reward of $400,000 — more than 1,500 times Gaza’s average monthly wage. Israel’s stated goal in the war is to destroy Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that rules Gaza and set off the war there by attacking Israel on Oct. 7. But despite a military campaign that has caused nearly 20,000 deaths in Gaza and reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble, Israel has yet to locate Mr. Sinwar and other senior Hamas figures considered key plotters of the attack 10 weeks ago. Israel considers Mr. Sinwar central to the Oct. 7 attack, which killed roughly 1,200 people, with some 240 others taken back to Gaza as captives, Israeli officials say. Now in his 50s, he was a founding member of Hamas in the late 1980s and developed a harsh reputation for punishing Palestinians suspected of spying for Israel. “He is a very tough guy, a brutal guy,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, an associate professor of political science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza who is now in Cairo.

ByMichael D. Shear Reporting from Washington Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said Wednesday that Gaza should be unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority once the war is over, offering a strong signal about what the United States sees as its preferred endgame in the fight between Israel and Hamas. The message, delivered during a meeting of foreign ministers in Tokyo, came as President Biden feels growing pressure to use his leverage to push for sustainable, long-term goals in the region and minimize civilian casualties. But increasingly, the United States and Israel are showing signs that their interests are diverging. The remarks by Mr. Blinken on Wednesday reflect a deep anxiety on the part of Mr. Biden and his aides inside the White House as the conflict enters its second month. What started in the days after Oct. 7 as an unambiguous rush to the defense of an ally has become amuch more complicated diplomatic challengefor the president to help define an alternative to open-ended war in the Middle East. Mr. Biden wields key leverage as a world leader strongly allied with Israel, and his administration has sought to rally Arab nations and others behind a vision that looks beyond the fighting and the deep emotions that have divided the region for years. On Wednesday, Mr. Blinken said there must be “affirmative elements to get to a sustained peace.” “These must include the Palestinian people’s voices and aspirations at the center of post-crisis governance in Gaza,” he said. “It must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.” Mr. Blinken offered no details about how such an arrangement might be implemented; it would not be a solution in the near term as the violence continues. But restoring the Palestinian Authority — which administers parts of the West Bank — to power in Gaza would not be easy even if Israel managed to end Hamas’s rule. Its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, is deeply unpopular. Many Palestinians view him as corrupt and say his attempts to win independence through peace talks have failed.

Palestinian TV Reporter and 11 Family Members Killed in Gaza,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/world/middleeast/mohammed-abu-hatab-reporter-killed-gaza.html,2023-11-03T23:43:43+0000,"Mohammed Abu Hatab is the latest journalist to die while covering the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more media workers than any other conflict in the area since 1992.","Mohammed Abu Hatab, a correspondent for a Palestinian television channel, and 11 members of his family were killed in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Thursday.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement Mohammed Abu Hatab is the latest journalist to die while covering the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more media workers than any other conflict in the area since 1992. ByGaya Gupta Mohammed Abu Hatab, a correspondent for a Palestinian television channel, and 11 members of his family were killed in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Thursday. Palestine TV, where Mr. Abu Hatab worked and which is run by The Palestinian Authority, said they were killed at home by an Israeli airstrike. On Friday night, the Israeli military said that after a review, it was “not aware of any military activity conducted by our forces in the vicinity of the location in question.” Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, said that Mr. Abu Hatab’s wife, son and brother were among the dead. The Committee to Protect Journalists said that more media workers have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war than in any other conflict in the area since it started tracking thedatain 1992. As of Friday, 36 media workers — 31 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese — have been killed since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7,the group said. Photographs showed people searching through the rubble of the home on Thursday and Friday, unearthing relics of the family’s everyday life. At Mr. Abu Hatab’s funeral on Friday, dozens of relatives, friends and fellow journalists wept and prayed above his shrouded body. Atop it rested a blue flak jacket and a microphone.

She says she cannot enjoy her freedom until her father, Ofer, is free. ByPatrick Kingsley Patrick Kingsley met with Sahar Kalderon, her mother and siblings in Tel Aviv. In the 52 days that Sahar Kalderon, 16, spent as a hostage in Gaza, it was not only her captors who terrified her. It was also the relentless Israeli strikes on the enclave, she said, as the Israeli Air Force pummeled the territory night after night inone of the most intenseair campaigns this century. “Many times I told myself that, in the end, I will die from Israel’s missiles and not from Hamas,” the teenager said in her first interview with the international news media since beingreleased from captivity on Nov. 27. “Will I ever see my family again?” she remembered wondering. “Will I return to my normal life? Will I not be killed? It’s complete helplessness.” It is that kind of sentiment that highlights Israel’s strategic bind as it attempts to free more of the people captured by Hamas and its allies during the Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel. Israel began its devastating counterattack on Gaza soon after the assault, seeking to rescue the roughly 240 hostages while destroying the group that led their abduction. The two-pronged strategy initially worked, as the Israeli army captured large parts of northern Gaza before agreeing toa brief trucein November to allow for the release of more than 100 hostages.

Early U.S. and Israeli Intelligence Says Palestinian Group Caused Hospital Blast,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/us/politics/hospital-gaza-us-intelligence.html,2023-10-18T15:02:35+0000,U.S. officials cautioned that the analysis is preliminary and that the United States was continuing to collect and analyze evidence.,"American and Israeli officials said their intelligence showed that the deadly blast at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday was caused by an armed Palestinian group, rebutting Palestinian claims that an Israeli strike caused the explosion.","Israel-HamasWar Advertisement U.S. officials cautioned that the analysis is preliminary and that the United States was continuing to collect and analyze evidence. ByJulian E. Barnes,Patrick Kingsley,Helene CooperandAdam Entous Julian E. Barnes, Helene Cooper and Adam Entous cover U.S. national security and reported from Washington. Patrick Kingsley covers Israel and reported from Tel Aviv. American and Israeli officials said their intelligence showed that the deadly blast at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday was caused by an armed Palestinian group, rebutting Palestinian claims that an Israeli strike caused the explosion. The U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive information, said they were basing their early analysis on multiple strands of intelligence indicating thatthe blast at Ahli Arab hospitalwas caused by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a group allied with Hamas. The group said Israel’s accusations that one of its rockets malfunctioned and hit the hospital were “false and baseless.” Hamas has not provided any documentation of Israeli involvement. The officials cautioned that the analysis was preliminary and that they were continuing to collect and analyze evidence. Neither side’s claims about who was responsible have been independently verified. The American intelligence, first mentioned by President Biden, includes satellite and other infrared data showing a launch of a rocket or missile from Palestinian fighter positions within Gaza. American intelligence agencies have also analyzed open-source video — recordings collected by journalists and others — of the launch showing that it did not come from the direction of Israeli military positions, the officials said. Israeli officials have also provided the United States with intercepts of Hamas officials saying the strike came from forces aligned with Palestinian militant groups. “The U.S. government assesses that Israel was not responsible for an explosion that killed hundreds of civilians yesterday at the Al Ahli Hospital in the Gaza Strip,” said Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. “Our assessment is based on available reporting, including intelligence, missile activity and open-source video and images of the incident.” Ms. Watson said the intelligence indicated that some Palestinian fighters in the Gaza Strip believed the explosion was likely caused by an errant rocket or missile launch carried out by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. “The militants were still investigating what had happened. We continue to work to corroborate whether the explosion resulted from a failed P.I.J. rocket,” she said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

This church has been turned into an inpatient ward with very serious cases — children, women, elderly people. The few hospital staff who are left here, about 10 hospital staff, are caring for patients in this church building, with patients literally sleeping on the church pews. ByLiam Stack Northern Gaza has no more functioning hospitals, the director general of the World Health Organization said, describing scenes of horror witnessed by aid workers in the ruins of two partially destroyed medical facilities. Aid workers who visited Al-Ahli and Al-Shifa hospitals on Wednesday during a rare humanitarian mission to deliver supplies “struggled to describe the immense impact recent attacks have had on these health facilities,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O. chief, said in astatementposted to social media. At Al-Ahli, the aid workers found rows of dead bodies lined up outside the hospital, while severely injured civilians writhed in pain on the floor and the pews of the chapel inside of it, he said. In avideothat Dr. Tedros posted to social media, a member of the medical mission stands inside the chapel, with injured people and crucifixes on the wall visible behind him. “There are patients here who have been injured for more than a month and have had no surgery; there are patients who have been operated on and are now getting post-operative infections because the hospital doesn’t have sufficient antibiotics,” the aid worker in the video, Sean Casey, says. “They are suffering enormously here,” he adds. “This is a completely unacceptable situation.” The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs took part in the mission, which it said was only the third humanitarian convoy to reach northern Gaza since a pause in fighting ended on Dec. 1 because of “the ongoing hostilities.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByKaren Zraick Naim Jawad still remembers the Israeli warplanes in the sky that forced his family to leave their West Bank home. He was 5 years old. “We ran away from death,” he said. Now he’s 61, a retired captain in the Correction Department of New York City, watching with anguish as another generation endures a new war, this time in Gaza, where about half the population is under 18. Mr. Jawad’s family arrived in New York after a brief stint in Jordan, joining a close-knit Arab American community in southwest Brooklyn. He has lived there ever since, raising seven children of his own and serving as vice president of the board of Beit El-Maqdis, a Sunset Park mosque. Lines of cars double-parked outside the mosque as worshipers arrived for the Friday prayer — the most important service of the week — for the first time since the Israel-Hamas war began last Saturday. Congregants flocked in, seeking a place to pray for loved ones back home and a place to find support. Empathy for Palestinians has become especially politically fraught in the days since the attack. The one-story building, with arched windows and a minaret, was a place where they could express their anguish to others who understood what they were going through.

We want to see an end to the war in Gaza.” ByMegan Specia,Stephen CastleandEsther Bintliff Reporting from London Hundreds of thousands of people marched through central London in a huge pro-Palestinian demonstration on Saturday, a tense day in which the police battled with a small right-wing group to keep order on some city streets. The large march in support of the Palestinian cause coincided with Armistice Day, when Britain commemorates those who fought in World War I and subsequent conflicts, and followed days of debate about whether the protest should be allowed to go ahead. A spokesperson for London’s Metropolitan Police Service said by phone on Saturday afternoon that about 300,000 people had attended the march, making it one of the largest protests in Britain in recent years. Earlier in the day, a right-wing group clashed with the police near the Cenotaph, a war memorial close to the prime minister’s official residence, shortly after a two-minute silence was held to mark Remembrance Day. Videos showed some people bursting through a cordoned-off area. By late Saturday, the police said that 126 people had been arrested. “The extreme violence from the right-wing protesters toward the police today was extraordinary and deeply concerning,”the police said in a statement, noting that a group had assembled early on “stating they were there to protect monuments, but some were already intoxicated, aggressive and clearly looking for confrontation.” They directed abuse at officers protecting the Cenotaph, the police said, and were “largely football hooligans from across the U.K. and spent most of the day attacking or threatening officers who were seeking to prevent them being able to confront the main march.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByFarnaz Fassihi,Patrick Kingsley,Aaron BoxermanandMichael Levenson The top political leader of Hamas was holding talks with Egyptian officials on Wednesday about a possible truce in its war with Israel in the Gaza Strip, as the United Nations Security Council separately worked frantically to craft a resolution to suspend the fighting that would not draw a veto from Israel’s staunchest ally, the United States. The talks in Egypt were taking place as concerns in Israel grow over the fate of the dozens of hostages still being held in Gaza, and as pressure grew on the Israelis to stop their military campaign and allow more desperately needed aid into the devastated enclave. Diplomats at the U.N. Security Council were engaged in their own intense negotiations in New York on Wednesday over a resolution that would call for extended pauses in the war, allow more aid into Gaza by land, air and sea, and urge the immediate release of all the hostages being held by Hamas. A vote had initially been scheduled for Monday, but was delayed repeatedly, including on Wednesday, and is now not expected until Thursday morning at the earliest. Council members have been fielding multiple last-minute requests by the Biden administration, according to several diplomats who spoke on the condition that they not be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The United States vetoed two previous cease-fire resolutions. The diplomats said the United States was concerned about part of the resolution calling for the establishment of a United Nations monitoring system to screen aid deliveries into Gaza. They said Israel had urged the United States to reject the monitoring system, because it would leave Israel with no role in searching cargo entering Gaza.

Supported by ByKatherine Rosman Photographs byJonah Markowitz Tovah Feldshuh was sitting on the subway recently, headed uptown, when she encountered something she had never witnessed in her 74 years of living in and around New York City: a public display of antisemitism. “Those effing Jews,” she said a passenger started ranting. Ms. Feldshuh, the film and Broadway actress who just completed a yearlong run as Mrs. Brice in “Funny Girl,” was stunned by the man on the A train who, she said, looked like a typical commuter. “Hate speech is the way you take an ax to society, the way you shatter it.” There is no city in the world that is home to more Jews than New York, and no city in this country as defined by Jewish sensibility and culture. Jews have helped shape the New Yorkiness of New York since they began immigrating from Europe in large numbers in the 19th century. But since Oct. 7, the start of the Israel-Hamas war, many Jewish New Yorkers have felt something entirely unfamiliar: a sense that they are not home or perhaps not even welcome. Many Jews say they have felt an uncomfortable shift in the city, a perception that their identity as New Yorkers is seen as secondary to their Judaism. “Like every other New York Jew, I’m really troubled by the rise in antisemitism in this place that’s always been regarded as a haven for Jews,” said Senator Chuck Schumer in an interview.

ByErin Nolan,Eliza FawcettandNate Schweber Crowds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators packed the streets of Brooklyn on Saturday as they called on the U.S. government to stop sending aid to Israel. The march was organized by the Palestinian-led community group Within Our Lifetime, and participants stretched for several blocks as they traveled from the Brooklyn Museum to the Brooklyn Bridge, chanting “Free, free Palestine!” The demonstration was the latest in a string of protests around New York City since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. Saturday’s march took place a day after Israeli forces beganwhat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called “the second stage of the war.” Waving a Palestinian flag as she marched, Alaa Essafi said that after Israel’s escalated attacks, it felt especially important that she travel from her home in New Jersey to support her “brothers and sisters in Palestine.” “Together we will send a message,” Ms. Essafi, 21, said. The museum has a large outdoor plaza, and it has been the site of several large-scale gatherings, including aBlack Lives Matter demonstration in 2020 that drew more than 15,000 people. Standing outside the museum, Hany Barakat, 34, said he had family in Gaza and that some had been killed during recent airstrikes. “It has to stop,” said Mr. Barakat, who is Egyptian and lives in New Jersey. The protest prompted the police to shut down several blocks of the Eastern Parkway. Helicopters and a drone hovered above the crowd. The crowd waved banners and held signs that bore messages including, “We demand a free Palestine” and “Let Gaza Live.” At the Brooklyn Bridge, a few people scaled a metal support structure and unfurled Palestinian flags, prompting protesters to erupt into chants of, “Gaza! Gaza! Gaza!” The demonstration began to thin as it crossed into Manhattan and daylight faded. Just before 7 p.m., as the crowd streamed through SoHo, the Muslim call to prayer echoed through the streets and event organizers instructed everyone to stop marching to allow time to pray. The final destination was Union Square, where hundreds of protesters stopped to beat drums.

ByMitch Smith,Lauren McCarthy,Ernesto LondoñoandMiriam Jordan Mitch Smith reported from Chicago, Lauren McCarthy from New York, Ernesto Londoño from Minneapolis and Miriam Jordan from Los Angeles. As news spread over the weekend that gunmen from Hamas, the Palestinian faction that governs the Gaza Strip, had killed hundreds and taken hostages in a surprise attack on Israel, Zarefah Baroud watched in horror from Seattle. Ms. Baroud, a doctoral student and activist who is Palestinian American, said she felt deep sadness for the Israelis who were killed and kidnapped. And she was immediately worried that those killings would be “used to justify genocide” against Palestinians. On Monday, Ms. Baroud managed to reach a younger cousin in Gaza. In an exchange of painful text messages, she learned that her aunt and five cousins, ages 9 to 18, hadbeen killedin a retaliatory airstrike. “Virtually every year there is a bombing campaign, but I’ve never heard my family talk as hopelessly about the situation,” said Ms. Baroud, 24, who faulted Israel for the escalation in hostilities. “There is nowhere to hide.” Palestinians in the United States have long grappled with the complicated history of their ancestral home and the foreign policy of their adopted one. Many have parents or grandparents who left the Middle East decades ago when the modern Israeli state was founded. Their families found refuge and built new lives in America, starting businesses, joining mosques or churches, enjoying a sense of freedom and stability.

The U.S. has been the only member of the Security Council to block demands for an immediate cease-fire. ByFarnaz Fassihi For the second day in a row, the United Nations Security Council delayed a vote on a resolution calling for Israel and Hamas to provide greater access for more humanitarian aid, and pauses in the fighting to make that possible, as diplomats wrestled with the United States on what it might allow to pass. Theannouncementof a delay on Tuesday followed hours of intense, closed-door negotiations and a Security Council session in which diplomats discussed the war in Gaza. It also followed days of negotiations since Friday, when the United Arab Emirates, which put forth the resolution, circulated the text among members. The draft resolution called for suspending the fighting long enough to allow the safe delivery of humanitarian relief to Gaza via land, air and sea and the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas. It also called for the establishment of a United Nations monitoring system to screen the aid deliveries. The proposed monitoring of aid by the U.N. has turned out to be the major obstacle for the United States, and the decision has now been referred to the White House, resulting in the multiple delays on Tuesday, according to several Security Council diplomats, who spoke on the condition that they not be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The diplomats said Israel was pressuring the United States not to accept putting the U.N. in charge of inspecting aid deliveries to Gaza, because it would effectively leave Israel with no role in screening them. According to the Security Council diplomats, if a concession on this issue is not reached before a vote is held on Wednesday, the United States could veto the resolution. Currently, the 100 or so trucks that enter Gaza each day travel from Egypt to Israel for inspection, then return to Egypt and snake their way to the Rafah border — a process that many diplomats and U.N. officials said was untenable and was slowing down the delivery of much-needed aid.

President Biden addressing the nation from the Oval Office after visiting Israel in October, following the breakout of its war against Hamas.Credit...Tom Brenner for The New York Times Supported by ByJonathan Weisman,Ruth IgielnikandAlyce McFadden Voters broadly disapprove of the way President Biden is handling the bloody strife between Israelis and Palestinians, aNew York Times/Siena College pollhas found, with younger Americans far more critical than older voters of both Israel’s conduct and the administration’s response to the war in Gaza. Voters are also sending decidedly mixed signals about the direction U.S. policy-making should take as the war in Gaza grinds into its third month, with Israelis still reeling from the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, thousands of Palestinian deaths in Gaza and the Biden administration trying to pressure Israel to scale back its military campaign. Nearly as many Americans want Israel to continue its military campaign as want it to stop now to avoid further civilian casualties. That split appears to leave the president with few politically palatable options. The findings of the Times/Siena poll hold portents not only for Mr. Biden as he enters the 2024 re-election year but also for long-term relations between the Jewish state and its most powerful benefactor, the United States. The fractured views on the conflict among traditionally Democratic voter groups show the continued difficulty Mr. Biden faces of holding together the coalition he built in 2020 — a challenge that is likely to persist even as economic indicators grow more positive and legal troubles swirl around his expected opponent, former President Donald J. Trump. Overall, registered voters say they favor Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden in next year’s presidential election by two percentage points, 46 percent to 44 percent. The president’s job approval rating has slid to 37 percent,down two points from July. But there is considerable uncertainty over whether disaffected voters will even vote. While it is still early, the race is flipped among the likely electorate, with Mr. Biden leading by two percentage points.

ByPatrick Kingsley Reporting from Jerusalem Israeli extremists caused widespread damage in a wave of attacks on Palestinian towns that lasted from Tuesday night until Wednesday night in revenge for the killing of four Israelis by Palestinian gunmen outside a nearby settlement in the territory. Scores of Israeli arsonists entered the Palestinian communities closest to the site of the shooting, setting fires that damaged dozens of cars, buildings and farmland, and spurring confrontations with Palestinian villagers. At least one Palestinian was shot and killed, and 12 others were injured, some of them in clashes with the Israeli security forces, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the settler attacks unacceptable, saying: “The State of Israel is a state of law. The citizens of Israel are all obligated to respect the law.” But Mr. Netanyahu also attempted to assuage hard-line allies in his far-right government by announcing that he would immediately advance plans to build 1,000 new homes in Eli, the settlement in the West Bank close tothe attackon Tuesday by Palestinian gunmen. Mr. Netanyahu said the decision, which will require further government approvals before construction begins, was a direct response to the attack. Two fighters from Hamas, the Islamist militia that controls the Gaza Strip, killed four Israeli civilians at a restaurant and gas station next to Eli, before being killed themselves. “Our answer to terrorism is to strike at it forcefully and build up our country,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement that was also issued on behalf of his defense minister,Yoav Gallant, and finance minister,Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right former settler activist.

Their country was under attack, they said. They needed to return. They needed to fight.

“It’s the thought that you have friends that will be in immediate danger, and you cannot help them,” said Yotam Avrahami, 31, one of the many Israelis who has been packing bags and preparing to join the fight.

Mr. Avrahami, who has lived in New York for four years, said he is lucky — his wife and 7-month-old daughter will stay in New York, safe from the violence. But his friends back home have already had loved ones die in the most recent attacks — and they have seen children killed, too.

“You’re trying to protect them,” he said. “It’s as simple as that.”

Mr. Avrahami spent about $2,000 on a one-way plane ticket, he said, and he has planned to report to a base on Sunday to see where he is needed. He has also been messaging another friend who was waiting to fly home from Dubai.“I’m not unique,” he said. “This is kind of Israelis across the board.”

But some flights into the country are being canceled, leaving Israelis abroad in limbo. Aaron Kaplowitz, the president of the United States-Israel Business Alliance, has spoken with friends across the world trying to get back, he said.

“Many of them are trying to sort out the logistics to find ways to get back to Israel, to either rejoin their reserve units or just to be around their friends and family,” he said.

Mr. Avrahami, for his part, said his wife is concerned for his safety. But, he said, “at the end of the day, she understands the necessity.”

They spent the day before his flight preparing: They went to The North Face to get supplies — comfortable clothes, a new pair of boots — to wear during what could be weeks of combat.

Avrahami, who works in investments and consulting with Deloitte, also said he had been emailing his colleagues and clients, letting them know that he would be out of the office for a while.
“I was planning on client engagement, workloads, managing next opportunities, business management, investment cycles and stuff like that,” he said. “My whole world was like that yesterday. Today, it just doesn’t matter anymore.”
